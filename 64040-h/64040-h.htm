<h3>CHAPTER XXVI.</h3>

<p class="ph3">DESIRE FULFILLED.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> great joy grew more credible when
all its story was told.</p>

<p>The glad tidings had been brought in
by an Atlantic liner. It appeared that
when the <i>Slains Castle</i> had got well
over half of her Pacific voyage, she had
encountered a great storm, and had
foundered upon the reefs among a small
group of islands, all her boats being
lost or destroyed. The captain, disabled,
with his crew and the solitary passenger,
had however managed to land on one
of the larger islands, whose simple
natives received them kindly, and put
them into the way of subsisting after
their own fashion. There they had lived,
roughly and hardly indeed, and cut off
from all communication with home, or
with civilisation, upheld only by the
hope that some ship, in some way
diverted from its course, might eventually
discover them and take them off.
Instead of such a ship, however, their
party was reinforced by a solitary white
man, who made his way to them from
his own refuge on one of the smaller
islands. How had he got there? they
asked eagerly. He told them the truth:
he was “a bad character”—a man who
had done desperate deeds of many sorts,
and he was there because he was “a
castaway” from an American ship—he
could scarcely tell whether by accident
or design. He seemed to think the
latter the most likely and the most
natural alternative in his case. Hunger
and solitude on a bare rock in the wide
ocean, had somewhat tamed him, and
the consciousness of a common fate soon
absorbed him into the little brotherhood
of the <i>Slains Castle</i>.</p>

<p>He had been with them some months
when some of the party secured a half-broken
empty open boat, which seemed
to have been washed off from a passing
schooner. This they patched up, and
then they began to think whether some
of them might not make one last dash
for the release of themselves and the
rest. The “castaway” was quite ready
to take to the sea again; he did not
seem to know fear, or he believed he held
a charmed life. He was an expert seaman,
and of really powerful physique.
Another must go with him, and another
only. The captain’s arm being still
disabled, the man selected as fittest
for the expedition was the first mate.
Despite all dangers their wild voyage
was safely accomplished; a civilised
port was reached, and a little steamer
was at once despatched to the island
to bring off the rest of the shipwrecked
party. The ship owners had determined
not to be premature in giving
this good news. They had waited till
every report was verified. Now, any
hour might bring telegrams from Captain
Grant and Charlie that they were safe
on American soil, and hastening across
the continent to take their Atlantic
passage home.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Of course there was wild and glad
excitement in the little house with the
verandah. But Lucy’s own joy was
still and solemn. The others thought
her very strong and calm. But she
knew that she often asked herself
whether she were waking or dreaming?
She knew that she realised anew the
distance and the dangers between
herself and her beloved. After the glad
telegram duly arrived and she knew the
very name of the Atlantic liner on which
Charlie was speeding towards her, a
clouded sky or a rising wind would
suffice to make her tremble! Ah, she
had learned</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">“to love as the angels may</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With the breadth of Heaven between,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and the next lesson of her life was to
be the bringing-down of that mountain-top
vision of serenity and security, and
the possessing of it still among the mists
and twists of the level lands. She had
learned that love is eternal, that love is
safe when out of sight—now she had to
learn that time is only a part of Eternity,
and that what is safe out of our reach,
cannot be in danger while it is within it.</p>

<p>She thought often in those days of
Mary and Martha, the sisters of Lazarus.
They, too, like her, had been through
the bitterness of death. Was it henceforth
abolished for them, so that they
could say, “O grave, where is thy
victory? O death, where is thy sting?”
Or did the impression wear off their
souls, so that they had to live through
all their grief again?</p>

<p>She went on, wondering. When we
are told that in the mysterious future
there “is to be no more sea,” we feel
that the language is only used as a
powerful image, to show us that there
shall be no more danger, no more
parting. But after all, what are danger
and parting, but for their fear and pain?
Is it not really those that “shall be no
more”? It seemed to Lucy that haply
in the highest ministries of life’s
immortal service the paths of those who
would be “about their Father’s business”
must still sometimes swerve from one
another. If “no more sea” was a
symbol of no more danger, and no more
parting, did not that in turn mean an
abiding sense that all is secure, a
present consciousness that all parting
involves joyful reunion? Then if our
souls, still clad in mortal weakness, can
but attain to this “perfect love which
casts out fear,” should we not be in
Heaven’s peace already?</p>

<p>Lucy resolved to go to Liverpool to
meet the steamer which had Charlie on
board. She resolved to go alone. For
the first time since his father went away
she would leave Hugh, assured now that
he was surrounded by wise kindness.
She longed for absolute silence and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_819"></a>{819}</span>
solitude on her journey to this reunion,
well nigh as sacred and solemn as those
generally guarded by the secrecy of death.</p>

<p>She preferred to go without any
“seeing off.” Those in her home,
those who loved her best, probed her
feeling on this head, and yielded to it.
They parted from her on her own
threshold.</p>

<p>“We will come to meet you both
when you return,” they said.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Husband and wife met. It was in a
crowd of strangers, and nobody there
took particular notice of the brown, lean,
sinewy man, who clasped a silvery-haired
young woman in his arms. Then
they held each other apart for one
moment, and gazed at each other,
noting all that was gone—all that was
changed, and all—ay, all!—that remained
for ever!</p>

<p>As for the conversation—the questions,
the answers, the narrations—that interrupted
the rapt silences of this single
day reserved for themselves only, what
was it but simply the story which has
been already told?</p>

<p>“They will be all at home to receive
us,” Lucy said, as, her hand clasped in
her husband’s, she told of the loyal
friendships which had closed around her
terrible waiting-time. “They are all
still there, just as they have been. The
house may be small for us all, yet I felt
sure this would be your wish.”</p>

<p>“You knew your husband,” said
Charlie, “and if our friends will stay,
they shall stay as we are—for another
year. By that time we shall have got
our lives into their regular grooves again—and
then, maybe, we shall all move
together into a larger house. As it is
God’s will that the solitary shall be
set in families, Lucy, surely it is never
more so than when the solitary have
upheld the family.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<div class="ddropcapbox w125">
<img class="idropcap" src="images/i_819.jpg" width="125" height="177" alt='W' /></div>

<p><span class="uppercase">hen</span> the hard frost
had broken, and
the streets were
full of slush and
melting snow,
Ada had to spend
her five cents
going in the Fifth
Avenue stage-coach
to and from
her business, for,
even with rubbers
on, she had got
her feet so wet
and her skirts so destroyed that she
found that it was in the end cheaper
to drive than to walk. The children,
too, had found it necessary to drive
to school. Marjory had been very troublesome
of late; she had been grumbling and
repining at her restricted life, saying that she
would rather make friends with the girls whom
Ada considered vulgar and beneath her, than
have such a dull, cheerless time. Ada had
noticed that her eccentric old man had not
been in the stage-coach for some time past,
and she wondered what had become of him.
She was sitting waiting for the boarding-house
dinner-bell to ring (in the public sitting-room),
when the fat lady, who took such an
inquisitive interest in her and her little sisters,
came in.</p>

<p>“Well, Ada Nicoli,” she said in her rough
friendly way, “don’t you wish you were the
young lady.”</p>

<p>“What young lady?” said Ada.</p>

<p>The fat lady put the <i>New York Herald</i> down
on Ada’s lap.</p>

<p>“Read it,” she said. “It’s the maddest
thing you ever heard. The crazy old man
whom you’ve often seen in the Fifth Avenue
stage-coach, and who ate his bit of bread and
cheese every day on the public seat in Madison
Square, and looked as poor as any tramp, died
a week ago.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Ada regretfully; “is he
dead?”</p>

<p>She had grown to look upon him as one of
her friends in the big cruel city, and now he
had gone too.</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s dead,” the fat woman said
emphatically; “and he’s left a mighty pile of
dollars behind him. He used to stint himself
of house-fuel, and go to bed whenever he got
home from business on a winter’s day to save
light, and wore clothes a coloured man
wouldn’t give to his father. What’s the use of
saving like that if you’re going to leave all
your fortune to a total stranger.”</p>

<p>“Poor old man,” the girl said; “he was
really rather mad, but somehow I liked him;
he seemed to belong more to the last century
than to this.”</p>

<p>“Well, it appears he’s left every dollar he’s
got to some girl that he thought deserved
some money, a milliner’s girl, the papers say,
who once saved his life in a snowstorm or
something like that.”</p>

<p>Ada read the long and highly-dramatic
account of the old man’s curious will.</p>

<p>“Yes, I wish I were the girl,” she said;
“but I fear there’s no fairy prince in disguise
watching my poor trivial round and common
task. But just fancy, a girl earning her own
living suddenly to find herself an heiress!”</p>

<p>The boarding-house bell sounded, and the
hungry children came bounding down to
dinner.</p>

<p>“Ada,” whispered Marjory at table, “a
man came to see you this morning, and I said
you were out. He asked me a lot of questions,
and I answered before I remembered that
perhaps you would rather I didn’t.”</p>

<p>“What sort of questions?” Ada said
smiling, and hoping that at last they were
going to receive news of their father.</p>

<p>“Where you worked, and how you went to
work, and if we were your only sisters. He
was quite a nice sort of man.”</p>

<p>“A gentleman, I think,” Sadie said with a
great air of worldly wisdom. “He said he
would call again after dinner to-night.”</p>

<p>“Did he not tell you what he wanted,” Ada
asked.</p>

<p>“No,” Marjory said, “and it was only after
he had gone that we found out how much we
had told him, all about mother, and everything.
Do you mind, Ada?”</p>

<p>“No,” Ada replied; “but try in future,
Marjory, to remember that you are getting too
big a girl to talk to strange gentlemen in that
confidential way.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After dinner that night the Irish servant toiled
up to the top of the high house to tell Ada
Nicoli that there was a strange gentleman
waiting to see her down below.</p>

<p>“And sure and I can’t think why you want
to come up to this attic in the evenin’, instead
of joining with the company in the parlour.
It would save my poor legs toiling up to tell
you when your friends arrive.”</p>

<p>“It’s the first time anyone has come to see
me, Bridget,” Ada answered, “and I like
having the children with me in the evening.”</p>

<p>Ada might more truthfully have remarked
that she did not wish her little sisters to enjoy
the company of the young business men who
frequented the boarding-house parlour in the
evening.</p>

<p>When she entered the parlour, a keen-looking
elderly man rose from his seat and
bowed to her. “Have I the pleasure of
addressing Miss Ada Nicoli?”</p>

<p>Ada bowed.</p>

<p>“I am Mr. Riggs.” He looked round the
room. “Have you any place where I could
talk to you in private, ma’am?”</p>

<p>Ada grew nervous from fear of some bad
news, but she had learnt to control her
feelings before the curious eyes of the
boarders.</p>

<p>“I have no private sitting-room,” she said,
“but perhaps I might take you into the
bureau.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, ma’am, I will not detain you
long.” When they were seated in the bureau,
which the lady of the house had willingly
vacated on hearing Ada’s reason, he said, “I
have come to tell you a piece of news which I
think will greatly astonish you. I came here
this morning and learnt the information from
your little sisters which identifies you in my
mind with the young lady I was seeking.”</p>

<p>Ada was turning from hot to cold and her
hands were tightly clasped together.</p>

<p>“My dear young lady,” he continued, “I
am Mr. Riggs of the firm of Jefferson Riggs &amp;
Co., lawyers, No. 10054, Broadway. Perhaps
you have read in the papers of the death of an
eccentric old gentleman who was a well-known
figure in the Fifth stage-coach, and in Madison
Square Gardens?”</p>

<p>Ada nodded her head. Her heart was
beating too quickly to allow her brain to seize
the points of the lawyer’s story.</p>

<p>“I was his lawyer,” he said, “and for many
years transacted all his business matters, but I
had no idea of his personal wealth. He had
altered his will many times during the last few
years, leaving his money first to one charitable
institution and then to another; but in his
last will, which he made as far back as
eight months ago, he has left you his entire
fortune.”</p>

<p>“Me?” Ada gasped. “Me? What do
you mean? He didn’t even know my name.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he did. He found it out quite easily.
Yes, my dear young lady. You will now be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_820"></a>{820}</span>
almost as wealthy as if your father had never
failed.”</p>

<p>“Oh, stop a minute,” Ada cried, “till I
can really understand it. Am I the milliner’s
girl that was mentioned in the papers? Oh,
I’m quite, quite certain you have made some
mistake. Do have pity on me, sir; I have
suffered so much,” and she put up her hand
to her head and swayed a little backwards and
forwards.</p>

<p>“Oh, please don’t faint, my dear young
lady. I am no ladies’ man, and I don’t know
what to do.”</p>

<p>“No, I will not faint,” replied Ada. “It
is really wonderful what a girl can bear. But
I hope you are not deceiving me.”</p>

<p>“I am quite sure I am not, if you are not
deceiving me, and personating Ada Nicoli. I
wish I could have broken it to you more
gently; but I am no ladies’ man.”</p>

<p>“You have done it very kindly,” the girl
said, with a great sob of joy in her throat,
“only I wish the old man was alive, that I
could thank him, and love him a little. He
was very lonely, I think.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he was very lonely,” the lawyer said,
“and it is strange what an impression you
made upon him.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how I could,” Ada replied
simply. “I never did anything.”</p>

<p>“I think I can understand,” the lawyer said
with a touch of gallantry which showed that
he was not such a poor ladies’ man as he had
asserted, bringing a pretty flush to her cheek.</p>

<p>After they had talked a few minutes, Ada
said—</p>

<p>“May I call the children down to tell
them?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” the lawyer replied. “The
affair is no secret.”</p>

<p>When Ada told the children that they were
no longer poor, and that they need not live in
the top attic-room in a boarding-house, they
took the news more complacently than their
sister had done.</p>

<p>“I’m glad we can go to a decent school,”
Marjory said, little knowing how her words
hurt Ada, who had worked her fingers
to the bone to pay for her middle-class
schooling.</p>

<p>“I wish we had been left a new poppa,
instead of some money,” Sadie said regretfully.
“If we’re rich again, you’ll drive about
with mumma, I suppose, and we won’t have
any fun. I like being poor.”</p>

<p>“And living in a hen-roost?” Ada asked
laughingly.</p>

<p>Sadie had always called their low-roofed
attic a hen-roost.</p>

<p>“Yes, ’cause I like sleeping with you better
than with a cross nurse.”</p>

<p>The old lawyer got up. He had to take his
spectacles off and rub them before he could see
his way across the room.</p>

<p>“My dear young lady,” he said, “you
have made their poverty so attractive that
the old gentleman’s fortune is scarcely
appreciated.”</p>

<p>“I must spend it very wisely,” the girl said,
“as it was so carefully hoarded together. It
is all so wonderful that I cannot believe it is
true.”</p>

<p>“I should like the old man to have had
the pleasure that has been mine in bringing
you the good news,” the lawyer said, bowing
himself out. “We shall have many business
matters to discuss later on, but I will leave you
now to enjoy the new good fortune with your
sisters.” He came back and said rather nervously,
“Remember, my dear, that you can
draw on me for any ready money you may
require. I will leave you a hundred dollars
now just to pay for immediate expenses, and
to-morrow you can have ten hundred more if
you like.”</p>

<p>When Ada Nicoli was going upstairs, as if
floating on wings rather than walking, she met
the fat lady boarder coming down.</p>

<p>“Well, I declare, Ada Nicoli, you look as
if the world wasn’t good enough for you to-night.
There’s enough happiness in your eyes
to light a whole street. Has your strange
visitor brought you good news?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Ada replied, “wonderful news.
He has just told me that I am the little
milliner’s girl whom the eccentric old gentleman
thought deserved some money.”</p>

<p>“Sakes alive!” the fat boarder exclaimed.
“Let me look at you,”—and she took the
girl by her shoulders and scanned her face.</p>

<p>“Are you the girl he left all the money
to?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Ada; “isn’t it extraordinary?
I can’t quite believe it is true!
It’s just like a fairy story.”</p>

<p>In another moment the girl was clasped in
the arms of the good-natured woman, and
was so cried over and petted that all the
boarders came out to hear the news, which
Ada could not tell them for the fulness of her
heart, and the fat boarder did it but badly, for
she was laughing and crying at one and the
same time.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE RESERVOIR—CHINESE MEDICINES—DUST—ADVANTAGES
OF THE LIFE—THE RAINS—FLOODS.</p>

<div class="ddropcapbox w125">
<img class="idropcap" src="images/i_820.jpg" width="125" height="243" alt='T' /></div>

<p><span class="uppercase">hat</span> summer, our
first on the ranch,
we made a large
reservoir to hold
200,000 gallons.
There was a convenient
gulch or
dip, which
drained a fair
stretch of hill
slope, and which
lent itself well
for the purpose.
We meant also
to run our share
of the flume
water into this
reservoir whenever
it was not
being used on
the ranch.</p>

<p>Many waggon
loads of sand
from the Silvero
Valley had to be hauled up by the little
grey team, and endless barrels of cement
from the station at El Barco five miles away.
It was a long tiresome job. There was
plenty of rock, with which to build the dam,
lying about on the hills, but to lift these
pieces on to the sledge, improvised for this
purpose, and bring them over hill and dale to
the reservoir site and there unload them, was
both very hard work and at times a little
dangerous, for the rocks were often so large
that they were not easily controlled, and were
always threatening to roll over on to the feet
or hands of the “master builder” and his
men.</p>

<p>There were some bad bruises before all the
names of the workers were written on the
cement top of the wall as an artistic finish to
the dam.</p>

<p>That was a very dry year, the summer
extending till December 5th, and after a dry
winter too. For this reason the breaking up
of the ground was all the harder, especially
that part which had been trodden hard by
cattle grazing for many years.</p>

<p>Again the ranchers went to work to manufacture
some implement that would help in
this difficulty, and a “clod masher” was
made out of some of the furniture cases, and
it did very good work.</p>

<p>We planted cypress trees too, all along the
windswept side of the ranch, as these grow
very fast, and we wanted to break the face of
the wind.</p>

<p>The rabbits, squirrels, and gophers gave us
some anxiety that first year by nibbling at the
bark of the young lemon trees. This had to
be stopped at once, for if the bark is badly
peeled off right round the stem of a young
tree, the tree will probably die. The
approved remedy is to paint the bark with
blood, a most disagreeable job, especially in
glaring hot weather. However, the trees
were not touched after that, for the rabbits
are dainty people.</p>

<p>A good store of firewood had to be hauled
from the Silvero Valley before the rains
should come, and some months earlier we had
stored away our winter supply of hay in the
barn. In the winter we also planted an
orchard of all varieties of fruit for our own use—pears,
apples, prunes, figs, apricots, peaches,
vines, strawberries, and raspberries. Altogether
we were very busy and worked very
hard, though we took our pleasures too,
sandwiched in between. We did a great deal
of driving and riding about among the
different mountain paths, and we still enjoy
this distraction as much as ever.</p>

<p>To take our lunch with us and stay away
all day, the boys riding ahead, with the dogs
following them, darting in among the brush,
wildly happy over every pretence of a scent,
leaping high over every obstacle, and adding
so much to our enjoyment by their evident
delight, is a pleasure without flaw. I must
not forget also a gun or two, stowed away in
the bottom of the carriage, for something
worth killing may cross our path. Jack-rabbits
are not good eating but are good
sport, and as they injure the trees, every
rancher shoots them when he gets the chance.
The dainty elegant road-runner must never be
hurt, and woe be to the “tenderfoot” who is
tempted to shoot that pretty, impudent-looking
little fellow, the skunk, who flourishes
his handsome black and white tail in your
very face. If you were a Chinaman, you
would secure him on any terms, even his own.
All Celestial medicines and cordials seem to be
compounded of the most offensive abominations
that can be discovered; it follows, of
course, that the skunk is a highly-prized
treasure in their pharmacopœia. What deceits
we have practised and what lies we have told
during Wing’s reign in the kitchen! He was
for ever wanting to doctor us, and had always
just the right remedy by him for whatever
complaint was to the fore. We soon became<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_821"></a>{821}</span>
very wary indeed of showing any sign of
physical trouble before him, for we were at
once pounced upon with hot drinks of
villainous compounds and rank smell, and we
had to be very diplomatic so as to escape
drinking them there and then, and thus get
the chance of pouring them down the bath
sink when his back was turned.</p>

<p>We always felt this to be a very dangerous
business, for the smell threatened to betray us.</p>

<p>For rheumatic pains he eagerly recommended
a sort of rattlesnake jam, which is made
with chunks of that attractive reptile cooked
in whisky, and potted for seven years, when
it is ready for use, and, according to Wing, is
an infallible cure.</p>

<p>But though these various animals are spared
for different reasons on our little excursions,
the Californian quail are very delicate food,
and a most welcome addition to the ranch
larder, where variety is a little difficult to get.
They also are very good sport. Wild pigeons,
too, are not to be despised.</p>

<p>These driving expeditions are best, however,
in the winter, spring, and early summer, when
the sun is not so hot, and when the roads have
been rained upon, and the terrible dust is laid.
Is there any dust like the Californian dust
after a dry season, I wonder? My husband
insists that in Australia and the Cape, and
other places where he and I have never been,
the dust is infinitely worse than in California;
he also reminds me of the dust in railway
travelling at home, and insists that this was
quite as disagreeable and much more dirty.
We do not agree on this point. But as I said
before, one accustoms oneself to almost anything,
and though we certainly take fewer
pleasure drives at the end of the summer,
waiting rather always for the first rains, yet
when I remember my first horror at San
Sebastian, on driving through waves, and
clouds, and curtains of dust, then I know by
comparison that I have reached a very
philosophical state of mind about this, one of
the necessary and undeniable evils.</p>

<p>What one enjoys most in this life is, I
think, the absolute freedom; that and the
great stretches of space around one are a
constantly increasing delight. To look across
these great sweeps of mountains, range after
range, and see in the distance the silver line
of the Pacific, and to feel the clean, pure wind
in one’s face, is like a baptism of new life.</p>

<p>At first the strange bareness of these
mountains almost wounds one’s eyes, and
their true beauty is not recognised. But as
one learns to know them better, their charm
grows more and more striking, and I almost
doubt if after a few years one would wish for
any change in their bold bare lines. In the
full midday sun they are not lovely, and in
some moods one would call them almost ugly,
so uncompromising are they in their grimness
and bareness: but their time of triumph is
when the changing lights of sunset begin,
when they are flooded with such matchless
colouring, so delicate and rich, that they seem
positively unreal.</p>

<p>During the winter rains all the odd jobs of
repairing are done: soldering, harness-cleaning
and mending, painting of waggons or carts,
and carpentering.</p>

<p>Most Americans are clever-handed, and can
turn from one job to another with unusual
facility. To see a man, who earns his living
by driving a delivery waggon, turn to in his
spare time and build a neat and comfortable
addition to his house, an extra bedroom, and
perhaps an enlargement of the sitting-room,
with a nice bit of verandah out of this, and all
well planned and well finished, is apt to
knock the conceit out of the young fellow
from home, who prides himself on being so
“clever with his tools.”</p>

<p>Our first winter was a very dry one, to our
great regret. The rainfall was much below
the average and much below what was needed
for the land. Less than seven inches fell
during the whole season, and an average good
fall is about fourteen inches. So the land was
never thoroughly soaked, and what was a more
anxious matter still, the storage of water
“way back” in the mountains was too scant,
and pretty certain to run short before the long
dry season should be over. So, indeed, it
proved, and we were greatly harassed, when
the water company began to cut down our
rations, leaving us barely enough to keep our
young trees going; and certainly not enough
to give them a chance of doing their best,
however diligently the “cultivator” might be
kept at work.</p>

<p>All that summer we were busy, tending the
trees and adding further improvements to the
ranch. When the second winter came, we
were hopeful then all our anxieties about
water would be set at rest by a good generous
rainfall.</p>

<p>The dry season had extended unusually far
into the winter months, no rain having fallen
till December 5th, when we had a few
small showers. Within three weeks of this,
it seemed as though we were to get our
desires to the full, for the rain came down in
torrents.</p>

<p>The Silvero river, which was supposed to
flow in the pretty valley below us, of which
we got such a charming glimpse from our verandahs,
had hitherto appeared to be a dry sandy
stretch more like a rough country road than a
river, and we had laughed at the very notion
of a bridge being ever needed to cross its
dangerous waters.</p>

<p>Wonderful tales of the miraculous possibilities
of the land are of course told here to
the credulous tenderfoot, and we did not feel
inclined to believe our friends’ accounts of
that very river’s deep and dangerous waters
during some rainy winters.</p>

<p>We had to make an apology that second
winter. For nine days the waters poured
down in an almost solid sheet; and with
hardly any cessation night or day. We were
all anxious and excited over this storm; and
constantly on the watch to see what would
happen. At the end of the first twenty-four
hours, we had rather a scare over our reservoir.
The sudden inrush of water from the hill
slopes around had filled it so quickly that
when my husband went up in the driving rain
to see what state it was in, he found, to his
dismay, that the water had reached the very
tops of the dam, and was just beginning to
sweep over, making at once a deep and
widening cut all along the lemon trees below.</p>

<p>The new wooden floodgate was so swollen
with the rain that it was as though riveted
into its place, and refused to open. In a few
moments my husband had darted down to the
barn, and returning with an axe, broke the
floodgate in pieces, when the danger was
over, and the water rushing away in a great
heavy mass found its way into a gully where it
could do no mischief. We saw, from the deep
cutting made in those few moments by the
water when it swept over the dam, what
terrible damage might be worked by these
rains. But we could hardly believe our eyes
or ears however, when we saw in the valley
the glistening of the water in the broad river-bed,
and heard the roar as though of a
cataract.</p>

<p>During the first lull that occurred we all
hurried down to the valley to examine more
closely what was going on. We found such
a turbulent, dangerous-looking river tearing
down the valley, that we were perfectly
fascinated, and would fain have stayed and
watched it for hours.</p>

<p>The river had already cut a great deep bed
for itself out of the wheat-sown meadows of
the valley, and every moment a great slice of
the bank would give way and silently slide
down into the water, which swallowed it up
relentlessly as it rushed past.</p>

<p>Great trees were lying in the river, in some
places all across it, making rough dams where
the water fought and leapt even more fiercely;
and as we stood there, we were horrified to see
one of the dear trees, so highly prized in this
bare land, go trembling down into the flood.
The sound of their roots straining and cracking
as the rushing floods tried to sweep them
away from their last bit of anchorage, was
most painful; it seemed almost like a human
struggle. All the ground was more or less
like quicksand, and we had to be careful
where we stepped, lest we should be “mired.”
As the rain came on again heavily, we were
forced to return home, though very unwillingly;
it was a scene of such wonderful
excitement.</p>

<p>We were very anxious, too, about friends
whose ranches were some miles further up the
valley, and whose land lay mostly rather low
down and near the river-bed. We found
afterwards that both had suffered considerable
loss, besides great anxiety. On one ranch the
river had in one night swept away eight acres
of beautiful olive-trees that were in full bearing.
This was a very cruel blow, over which the
whole neighbourhood, I think, mourned, but
which the young rancher and his wife bore
with the brave cheery spirit which is, I think,
a noticeable charm in most Americans. The
young wife gallantly carried the heavier share
of the blow, by dismissing her servant, and
herself doing the housework and cooking.</p>

<p><span class="uppercase">hose</span> of you, my
dear girl friends,
who are members
of large families,
know how very
soon the little
ones begin to
observe what is
passing around
them. One
never-ending
marvel, in connection
with infant
life, is the amount of knowledge gained
during the first year of a child’s existence.</p>

<p>The little creatures come into an unknown
world where everything is strange. Even the
mother’s face has to be studied and learned
off by heart.</p>

<p>How quickly the baby eyes begin to follow
the movements of those around them! How
soon they learn to discriminate between one
face and another, one object that is pleasant
to the sight and a second that inspires fear or
dislike!</p>

<p>How marvellous is that instinct of self-preservation
which moves the little hand to
twine itself round an outstretched finger, or to
clutch at any object within its reach!</p>

<p>Has it not been to you, baby’s sister, almost
as much as to the mother, a source of pride
and delight to observe that the new-comer was
“beginning to take notice”? If the downy
head is turned in your direction, there is quite a
ring of triumph in your voice as you say, “I
am sure he knows me.”</p>

<p>You see, I picture my girls as loving sisters
with tender, motherly instincts, and I decline
to believe that there is one amongst them who
does not love these little ones.</p>

<p>If children begin to observe so soon, how
important it is that those who are round and
about the life-path, on which, as yet, they can
only place a little tottering foot, should be
careful that they see only what is worthy of
imitation. We, who are, perforce, the
patterns which the children are certain to
copy, should be doubly watchful over ourselves
for their dear sakes.</p>

<p>You and I need to be ever on the watch on
our own account, and the prayer “Lord, I cry
unto thee. Keep the door of my lips. Incline
not my heart to any evil thing. Deliver my
feet from falling,” must often go up from our
hearts to God, if we are sensible of our needs
and weaknesses.</p>

<p>Have you not a double reason for the
prayer that you may be kept from sin, whether
in word or deed, if you are elder sisters in
homes where the children must certainly learn
by your example? I would not only urge you
never to utter a wrong or impure expression,
but also to avoid the foolish talk which even
some older people think the only kind suited
to children. Use habitually the best words
you know, so that the little ones may have
nothing to unlearn that they have heard from
your lips. Speak clearly and distinctly, avoid
shrieking, boisterous laughter, and discordant
tones, so that baby’s voice, imitating yours,
may be clear and even musical from the first.</p>

<p>Be gentle and graceful in your movements.
Do not throw yourselves about or be rough,
careless or boisterous in manner, for if you are,
you will soon see a little reflection of your
doings in the toddling thing who smashes his
toys and laughs at the destruction he has
wrought.</p>

<p>Be orderly in your own habits, and teach
the little ones to put away their toys when
done with, in places provided for them. I
may note here that children are often untidy
and needlessly destructive of their toys because
no provision is made for orderly ways,
and no settled places given for their childish
treasures. Let them thoroughly enjoy the use
of these, but teach them that their toys are
worth something, and that wilful destruction
results in loss to themselves.</p>

<p>Turn a bright, happy face for a child to
study, that your smile may be reflected in his.
Cultivate a cheerful disposition and an even
temper, that you may rejoice in seeing joyous
little ones in your homes.</p>

<p>Apart from ill-health and the consequent
bodily suffering which naturally makes the
poor little people fretful and peevish, I
honestly believe that many mothers are
responsible for the ill-tempers of their children.
If they had always cultivated habits of self-restraint,
and prayerfully watched against and
checked every tendency to discontent, angry
passions, selfishness, etc., I am convinced they
would have had less cause to mourn over
peevish, passionate, ill-tempered, exacting
children.</p>

<p>I have used the word <i>always</i> advisedly.</p>

<p>The cultivation of every pure, right, holy
habit, temper and method of speech, should
begin long before a young mother actually
clasps her child to her breast, if he is to come
into the world such as she would have him
to be.</p>

<p>With what widely differing feelings do
parents look forward to the gift of a child!
In some cases it is in the hope of keeping
property in the direct line, so that others may
not inherit it.</p>

<p>Dear ones, it may be that none amongst you
have need to cherish such thoughts, or to
expect any great share of this world’s wealth,
for those who may some day call you by the
sweet name of mother. On all who bear it
will devolve the solemn responsibility of
training your children for something greater,
higher and better than the richest earthly
inheritance.</p>

<p>It must never be forgotten that it is the
children of human mothers who are the heirs
of immortality. It is the glorious privilege
and duty of the mother to teach her little ones
the old, old story of God’s love in Christ
Jesus, and to put before them the precious
truth that in Him and through Him they
become children of God. “And if children,
heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ.”</p>

<p>Children are sometimes used as outlets for a
mother’s vanity and love of display. She
delights to clothe them in the richest and
costliest of silks and laces, less for their
comfort than to show that she is wealthy
enough to do so. These things are of little
real account.</p>

<p>The soft woollen garments knitted and
fashioned by the loving hands of a poor
mother, and the mere scraps of material
adorned with pretty stitching by her busy
fingers, and kept in snowy purity, will be just
as comfortable and becoming as the more
costly clothing.</p>

<p>In choosing a nurse to be associated with
you in the care of your children, think of what
you would fain be for their sakes, and try to
find one who will work with you in a like
spirit. Never give up your own share in the
work or the supervision of the nurse’s, except
from dire necessity. I would be the last to
suggest that you should show a suspicious,
prying spirit; but let it be understood that
the nurse is your co-worker, and that, in
trusting her with your children, you place
your greatest treasures in her partial keeping.
My own practice has always been to trust
those who served in my home, unless something
occurred to justify a change of opinion.</p>

<p>In dealing with the little ones be absolutely
true. Let there be no shams or make-believes
on your part, and allow none in others.
Children are wonderfully quick to detect
shams, or even an approach to untruth, and
how keenly they study their elders! I hope
it is not derogatory to the child for me to say
that they and dogs are curiously alike in
judging character. The child will meet the
advances of one stranger with open arms,
whilst no bribes or blandishments will induce
her to look at another. The dog will generally
make a like choice. Before reason can have
much to say in the matter, the child exercises
its God-given instinct in making or refusing to
make friends with a new-comer.</p>

<p>I was in a room with a number of people
one day, when a little girl of four was brought
to see the visitors. All but one tried to coax
her into friendliness but in vain. The
exception was a sea-captain, rugged, sunburnt,
and with a face seamed by small-pox. He
made no attempt to entice the child, beyond
smiling in response to her frequent gaze. At
length she went quietly to him, laid her hand
on his knee and bade him lift her up. The
rugged face looked beautiful in its kindliness
as he raised the child in his arms, and a
moment after felt a soft kiss on his cheek, and
a curly head nestling on his breast. A more
lovable nature than that which dwelt beneath
that man’s unpromising exterior, it would
have been hard to find; and so evidently the
dog of the household decided, for he followed
the child and tried to push his nose beneath
the captain’s one free hand.</p>

<p>I often think that our four-footed friends
set us examples worthy of imitation in dealing
with our little ones. Most of us would rather
bear pain than see a child suffer, even if not
impelled to pity and tenderness by motherly
love. But we are not always sympathetic in
matters which are very real trials to the
children. I have heard people say, “How
can one be expected to do anything but laugh
at the ridiculous things children cry and grieve
about?” If the trouble is a real one to the
child, we may sympathise with the sorrow,
though we may smile at the cause of it. Only
do not let us spoil everything by allowing the
child to see us smile whilst professing to pity
and condole.</p>

<p>It is harder for some natures to sympathise
with the little ones in their play than in their
grievances. To do the latter is natural to
every kindly heart, but very often we find it the
hardest possible task to be a child with a
child. The healthy little one is not often
quiet in play-time, and busy mothers, weary
with very real work, are glad to confine all
romps within nursery walls, or to banish the
players to any place out of sight and hearing.
Believe me, there is no time when a mother’s
supervision is more needed than during play-time.
I was brought to realise this, as I had
never done before, quite lately.</p>

<p>A young mother, herself one of a large
family, said to me, “My childhood would have
been one of the happiest possible, if only my
mother had been oftener with us in play-hours,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_823"></a>{823}</span>
but she had no idea how miserable I was then.
One of my sisters, younger than I, had a
passionate temper, a will of iron, and a selfish,
exacting disposition combined with unusual
beauty and—when she chose—with the most
winsome ways imaginable. By these combined
qualities she dominated the nursery, got all
her own way, and generally succeeded in
making everyone appear to be in the wrong
but herself. My mother knew this too late to
prevent my childish happiness from being
spoiled, and both she and my father grieved
over it. ‘Why did you not speak?’ they
said. ‘We should have believed you, for you
were always true.’</p>

<p>“The fact was, I felt powerless before the
strong will of my sister, who succeeded in
making me think myself of no account in
comparison with herself. I was not beautiful
like her, and she was constantly taunting me
with what she called my ugliness. Well, I
can thank God that whilst my parents still
lived, things were put right with them, and no
one was so near to them as I was. And, if I
possessed a less share of good looks, I had
enough to win the love of a true heart and
keep it; so I must not complain. Only I
cannot quite forget that I lost the happy
childhood my parents meant me to have, for
want of my dear mother’s more frequent
presence during our play-time.”</p>

<p>When you attain to the glory of motherhood,
beloved girl friends, let each of you learn to be
a child with your children. You will not lose
by this, and they will gain enormously.</p>

<p>I spoke of our four-footed friends. Look
at puss with her kittens. Does she stand on
her dignity at play-time? Or the mother
doggie. Does she disdain a game at romps
with her fat, roll-about puppies? Both these
furnish examples for human mothers, and
depend on it, such will learn far more of their
children’s real dispositions during play-hours
than at any other time.</p>

<p>Years ago I saw an outdoor picture which
I have never forgotten. A little lamb had
been born very late in the season, and, after
all the rest of the flock had been removed, it
remained with its mother the only occupants
of a field. As soon as it was old enough, it
showed all the ordinary tendencies of its kind,
and began to skip and frolic about the field.
But it had no playfellows, and would soon
return, quiet and disheartened, to its mother’s
side.</p>

<p>The ewe rose to the occasion. She still
carried her winter coat which made active
movements somewhat difficult, but in spite of
this, she joined in a game at romps with her
little one. Anything funnier, more ungainly
than her efforts at skipping and prancing
round, I never expect to see, but she persevered
to the delight of her lamb, so long as the two
remained in the field. She left in my memory
one of the sweetest pictures of motherly
sympathy I ever witnessed.</p>

<p>It is not possible to do more than touch on
the duties as well as the glory of motherhood,
for the subject is equally vast and important.
In all our talks in the twilight our object has
been rather to suggest future thought on
matters of importance, than to exhaust the
subject during a sitting. You, my dear ones,
if spared to be mothers, will have to study
many things, if you are to be worthy of such
a sacred trust. You will need loving and
sympathetic natures, great self-control and
constant watchfulness over self, in order that
your example may be good for the little ones
to follow. You will need tender, enlightened
consciences to keep Duty ever to the front,
and Inclination subservient to its call. You
will find that you must unlearn as well as
learn many things in order that you may only
teach what is best. You will have to study
the parts that others fill in the environment
of your children so that they may have pure
companionship, friends and teachers whose
influence shall be second only to your own in
doing them good. You will have to plan in
ways small and great for the growth, health
and general well-being of their bodies, but
above and beyond all you must never forget
that something more precious than all the
world has been entrusted to you—an immortal
soul with each child.</p>

<p>I need not say that if you realise the vastness
of this trust, you will be a prayerful
mother. Very conscious of your own weakness
and inability rightly to fulfil your God-given
work, you will constantly seek the grace
which is sufficient for you and for all: the
strength which is made perfect in the weakness
of His believing servants. “For the
weakness of God is stronger than men.”</p>

<p>You will be ever prayerfully striving after
greater nearness to the Source of strength, and
so, taking your little ones in your arms or by
the hand, you will lead them into the
Presence, and as you lift up heart and voice
in supplication and prayer, teach them to
realise from their earliest days the Divine
Fatherhood, and the saving love of God in
Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>It seems coming down from the greater to
the less when, leaving for a moment the
teaching of the Bible about the glory and
responsibility of motherhood, I open another
book and quote a few words from the writings
of a high-souled poetess, one who without
knowing the glory, the bliss, the responsibility
of hearing a child call her mother, has yet
grasped, in a higher degree than any other
writer I know, the reality of all these things.</p>

<p>It was fitting to place first of all the testimony
of Bible history and teaching on the
value of a child and the glories and responsibilities
of motherhood. But in these days it
will do us good to read some words from one
of Mrs. Browning’s poems and to find that
along with her great mental and poetic
powers, there dwelt in her fragile frame the
warmest of motherly hearts, the strongest
motherly instincts. As Aurora Leigh, she
writes—</p>

<p>I will not multiply quotations. These are
more than enough to justify what I have said
of the writer. I hope many of you are already

<p>And now, my dear girl friends, I must close
our talk to-night with the announcement that
in one sense it is to be our last, but not in
another.</p>

<p>Three years have come and gone since our
Twilight Circle was first formed. Some of us
met then as old acquaintances, but we have
become far more than mere acquaintances to
each other. I believe we shall remain true
and lifelong friends. One of you, looking
regretfully forward to the probable cessation
of our meetings, asks quite pathetically—</p>

<p>“Have you nothing more to say to us, your
girls?”</p>

<p>I feel that I still have many things to speak
about, and yet that it would not be advisable
to arrange for meeting at stated periods for
the present. Yet I look forward to our
keeping in regular touch with each other; for
our dear friend the Editor has suggested a
“Twilight Circle Correspondence Column”
for us. In it I hope to answer some of the
letters already received, and others which you
may address to me in the future about our
Twilight Talks. It has always been to me a
source of great regret that many of your
letters have perforce remained unanswered so
long. I also hope to bring some of you, dear
ones, into touch with each other during the
coming year by means of these letters.</p>

<p>I pray that God will add His blessing to
what has been said, and that you may all be
better daughters, sisters, friends, wives, and,
in due time, mothers through our many
happy meetings “In the Twilight Side by
Side.”</p>

<p class="ph3">A STORY FOR GIRLS.</p>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">By</span> EVELYN EVERETT-GREEN, Author of “Greyfriars,” “Half-a-dozen Sisters,” etc.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XXV.</h3>

<p class="ph3">MAY’S INVITATION.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">I should</span> like to go, Aunt Cossart, of
course; but I will not accept unless you
can really spare me. Now that Effie is
away, I know it is dull for you, except in
the evenings when Oscar is here.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Cossart held in her hands the
note of invitation, which a servant from
Monckton Manor had just brought.</p>

<p>“Do you know who these friends are
that Miss Lawrence thinks you would
like to meet?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Sheila simply.
“They have a good many summer
visitors at the Manor, and they are all
nice people; but May does not say
whether they are any I have seen
before.”</p>

<p>“Well, I think you had better go. It
is only for three days; and I’ll ask Ray
to come and spend the time with me.
She had half promised me a visit before
this. And Oscar need not go to the
office regularly—that was quite understood.
Only he is such a boy for his
duty that there seems no keeping him
back. However, your uncle will soon be
home now; and then perhaps we shall
settle something different. But write
your note to Miss Lawrence, and say you
will be there to-morrow. I will drive you
across. I want to go and see Mrs. Frost,
and so it will all be on the way.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you so much, Aunt
Cossart, you are very good. I shall like
it very much if you are not left alone.”</p>

<p>Sheila ran to write her note with a
light heart. Effie was away on a visit
to her friends the Murchisons. It had
been a great advance that she should
pay a visit by herself, with only Susan in
attendance. It seemed quite a step in
her recovery, and all had been pleased
that she wished it and felt able for it.
In her absence Sheila and Oscar had
become quite like the children of the
house, and the girl was often surprised
at the warmth of her affection towards
her aunt, despite the little fussiness and
lack of tact and judgment which had so
often irritated her in old days.</p>

<p>Still, the thought of a few days with
May was quite a treat. She had not
been over to the Manor very often of
late. May had been visiting some
friends, and the girls had not met since.
It was delightful of May to think of
asking her for a night or two. That
kind of visit was so much more satisfactory
than just going over for the day.</p>

<p>Truth to tell, Sheila thought little of
the “friends” she was asked to meet.
It was May she chiefly cared to see,
although the house party at the Manor
when it was full of guests, was always a
very pleasant one.</p>

<p>“May will be thinking about her
wedding,” Sheila observed to her aunt
as they drove along in the bright June
sunshine. “Ray says that North does
not see the use of waiting; and now
that he has found that nice house over
the bridge, and in the country, though
not too far away, there doesn’t seem
anything to wait for. I think he and
May will be very happy together; and it
will be nice to have her so much
nearer.”</p>

<p>“Yes, North is a steady good boy,
and deserves a nice wife; but I should
never have guessed that he would marry
into the county, as people call it. That
always seemed more in Cyril’s line.”</p>

<p>Sheila laughed. She had seen
through Cyril’s veneer long ago, and
thought much more of North’s sterling
worth and perfect sincerity and simplicity.
It was these qualities which
had attracted May, and Sheila thought
she showed her sense and good feeling
in being so quick to appreciate them.</p>

<p>May received her with open arms;
and in a short time they were ensconced
in one of their favourite retreats, pouring
girlish confidences into each other’s
ears.</p>

<p>May told of her approaching marriage,
which was to take place in September,
so that they would get a run on the
continent a little later than the August
rush, and yet be settled at home
comfortably for the winter.</p>

<p>“You must come and see the house
to-morrow,” cried May. “It is such a
dear old place; not big, you know, but
quite old-fashioned; and such a quaint
old walled garden that shuts us out from
the world. It is away from other houses
now, close to the village of Twick; but
as North says, Isingford is creeping out
that way, and it won’t be country many
more years; but our walls will keep us
secluded, and inside it is all quite
delightful. We have two acres altogether,
and it is so well planted and laid
out that you would think it was much
more.”</p>

<p>Sheila was keenly interested in her
friend’s prospects; and time slipped
away fast. The softened light told of a
westering sun, and May suddenly sprang
up crying—</p>

<p>“I am sure it must be tea-time and
past. Come along, Sheila. You must
be introduced to our other guests!”</p>

<p>They threaded the garden paths,
crossed the blazing lawns, towards the
group of stately cedars beneath which
several persons were seated. Sheila
could not see their faces distinctly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_826"></a>{826}</span>
through the sweeping boughs; but
suddenly somebody rose and made a few
forward steps, uttering a pleased little
exclamation, whilst the girl gave a joyful
cry and sprang forward.</p>

<p>“Miss Adene! Oof—how delightful!
Oh, May, why did you not say that Miss
Adene was here?”</p>

<p>The meeting was a warm one on
both sides. Sheila’s glance swept round
the little group, but there was no other
familiar face, except that of the hostess.
She was introduced to the other guests;
but was quickly seated beside Miss
Adene asking questions in her eager
way, and telling of herself in turn.</p>

<p>“Yes, we think that Guy is quite
recovered now,” said Miss Adene. “He
is wonderfully better, even since you saw
him. We went to Oratava for a little
while, and then when it grew too hot
there we returned to Madeira; and before
we left he seemed as strong as ever,
and has not lost a bit of ground since he
got home. He begins to ride and drive,
and walk about just as he did before his
illness. Ronald declares that he will
soon be quite a superfluity at the Priory.
Guy is able to take everything into his
own hands again.”</p>

<p>“I am so glad! How happy Lady
Dumaresq must be! And dear little
Guy, how is he?”</p>

<p>“Oh, as well as possible, the rogue!
And he has not forgotten you. He sent
you lots of kisses, and an injunction that
you were to come and see him very soon.
‘Tell her if she doesn’t come soon,’ he
said, ‘I shall go mad.’”</p>

<p>“He didn’t,” cried Sheila, laughing,
“Oh, how utterly sweet of him! He is
a darling; I should so like to see him
again!”</p>

<p>Miss Adene asked after Effie, and
time flew quickly by. It was so nice to
have lost all that old miserable feeling
Sheila once thought she must always
experience if she met again these friends,
whose kindness towards her had been
the immediate cause of her banishment
from Madeira, and who must, she
knew, have guessed in some measure at
the cause of it.</p>

<p>But Miss Adene seemed to have put
that memory right away, and there was
nothing but pleasure in meeting her
again. It was May’s voice which
interrupted the talk at last.</p>

<p>“Sheila, I want to get some forget-me-nots
from the stream to decorate the
dinner-table with. They are so lovely
just now, and look exquisite with moss
on the white cloth. Do come with
me!”</p>

<p>Sheila jumped up at once, and the
two girls hastened away together.
May’s face was rather flushed, and her
eyes were shining brightly. The stream
which ran through the park was famed
for its beds of blue forget-me-not, and
there was no trouble in finding flowers
enough and to spare.</p>

<p>Presently the sound of voices, men’s
voices, broke upon their ears, and May
jumped up, exclaiming—</p>

<p>“Here is North! And he is bringing
back a guest of ours, who wanted to see
the works. You talk to him, Sheila,
and let me have a few words with
North. I have so much to say.”</p>

<p>There was a merry gleam in May’s
eyes, but Sheila suspected nothing until
a sudden bend in the path brought
them face to face with the approaching
pair, and she saw that North’s companion
was none other than Ronald
Dumaresq.</p>

<p>Then for a moment astonishment
robbed her of her self-control, and the
flowers she was holding in her arm
slipped in a mass to the ground.
Laughingly Ronald sprang forward,
picked them up, and took possession of
the load.</p>

<p>“I hope you and your flowers are
alike in nature, Miss Cholmondeley, and
that I am not quite forgotten.”</p>

<p>He stretched out his hand and took
hers, and she, looking up into the
bright manly face, forgot her tremors
and her embarrassment, and felt
nothing but a sense of pure happiness
in being face to face with him again.</p>

<p>“I see you do not need an introduction,”
said May’s voice, with a
mischievous ring in it; and then the
four began pacing back slowly towards
the house, falling naturally into two and
two.</p>

<p>“You have seen my aunt?” asked
Ronald.</p>

<p>“Yes; but she did not say that you
had come too.”</p>

<p>“No, I asked her not. I wanted to
give you a surprise. I hope it has not
been a very disagreeable one.”</p>

<p>Sheila’s old clear laugh rang out
through the wood.</p>

<p>“If you are fishing for compliments,
sir, you won’t get any out of me!”</p>

<p>“And I am so fond of them,” said
Ronald pathetically. “Don’t you think
you might be nice and kind, and say
how much you have missed me since we
parted?”</p>

<p>“Oof!” cried Sheila, “what next am
I to say?”</p>

<p>“Well, if you won’t say the pretty
thing, I must. Do you know, Miss
Cholmondeley, that after the sudden
departure of a certain nameless person
from Madeira, everything got so stale
and unprofitable to me that I seriously
threatened to come home alone; and I
should have done so if they hadn’t
moved on elsewhere.”</p>

<p>Sheila’s face was glowing, but she
answered by a gay laugh; and the
laugh was not forced, for was she not
very, very happy?</p>

<p>“You may laugh, but I assure you it
was no laughing matter to me. Sheila,
did you want to go off in that sudden
fashion? Did you go of your own
accord?”</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly and took her
hand; she gave one swift upward
glance, and then dropped her eyes.</p>

<p>“It was arranged for me,” she said.</p>

<p>“You did not want to go yourself?”</p>

<p>“No, not then. I was very angry
about it. I had a great many wicked
thoughts, which I was very much
ashamed of afterwards, because it was
such a good thing that I did go exactly
at that time. It might just have been
settled for me in the very best way
possible.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Ronald
quickly.</p>

<p>“You know Oscar, my brother, fell ill
of typhoid fever just as I got back. If
it had not been for—for—that, I might
not have been with him, and I don’t
know what I should have done then.”</p>

<p>Ronald’s face cleared; for a moment
he had looked anxious.</p>

<p>“I saw Oscar just now at the
works,” he said. “I liked him very
much indeed. You are not much alike,
but there was something in his voice
and expression which reminded me of
you.”</p>

<p>“I wish I were more like Oscar,”
said Sheila humbly. “He is much
better than I shall ever be.”</p>

<p>“Don’t wish to be anything but yourself,
Sheila,” said Ronald with sudden
impetuosity, “for I want you just as
you are.”</p>

<p>The blood surged up into Sheila’s
face; this was taking the bull by the
horns with a vengeance. Ronald
seemed to know he had committed
himself, and stood his ground, holding
her hands fast in his, and again letting
the poor forget-me-nots drop to the
ground.</p>

<p>“Sheila, I did not mean to be so
sudden, I promised not to be in such
haste; they all tell me I must not
expect to carry everything before me.
But when I see you, I forget everything
except that I love you. Oh, Sheila,
won’t you try and love me too? I am
so sure I could make you happy, if you
would only give yourself into my
keeping.”</p>

<p>Her eyes were on the ground, but
there was that in her down-bent
quivering face that gave Ronald hope
and courage. He bent over her and
touched her cheek with his lips.</p>

<p>“Sheila, won’t you say you will try to
care for me a little?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Ronald, I do!” she suddenly
exclaimed; and then they forgot everything
else in that wonderful first embrace
of love, in which the gates of a new
world seemed flung open before them,
and they walked alone in that new
world, as though it were their own for
evermore.</p>

<p>“But, Ronald,” said Sheila gravely,
after those first golden moments had
passed, and they began to awake to the
realities of life, “you must not ask me
to be impatient or selfish. I must think
of other people as well, and I must not
promise anything without the consent of
my uncles.”</p>

<p>“But you are nearly of age, my
darling; you will soon be your own
mistress.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but that is not quite it, Ronald.
My uncles have been very kind to me;
my home is with one of them, and my
aunt begins to depend upon me. I
must not be selfish; you would not like
me if I were. We may have to wait a
little perhaps, but you won’t mind that,
will you, Ronald?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Ronald.
“And I have an idea your aunt will set
herself against this, and she rules your
uncle. I won’t have you spirited away
from me again, Sheila. That I can’t
stand!”</p>

<p>She laughed and put her hand upon
his lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_827"></a>{827}</span></p>

<p>“Don’t say rude things of my nice
aunt and uncle. They are a great deal
kinder to me than I deserve, for I did
not always treat them very nicely.”</p>

<p>“Stuff! you were an angel; it was
they who bullied you, and that Effie
always wanted to come between us.”</p>

<p>“No, she didn’t; that is all your
fancy. Effie is much nicer than you
think, and is getting more sensible and
stronger every week. She will be on
our side, I know. And, Ronald, I only
want us to be reasonable and unselfish,
and not put ourselves and our affairs
first. If you asked Miss Adene, she
would tell you just the same.”</p>

<p>“I know she would,” said Ronald,
laughing, and then in a graver voice he
added, “Yes, Sheila, you are quite
right; one must learn to take the
second place, and think of other people
as well as oneself. If you can be
patient, so can I; and I love you all the
better for your unselfishness.”</p>

<p>“I wish I were unselfish,” said Sheila
with a sigh. “I am only trying to be,
and it does not seem quite so hard when
one is very, very happy.”</p>

<p>Then Ronald bent over her, kissed
her once more, picked up the fallen
flowers, and walked towards the house.</p>

<h3>PART VI.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Carrying</span> out the directions given last month
for preparing the hives for winter, must not be
delayed later than the middle of September.
All our colonies being strong and having
plenty of stores, they should now be wrapped
up warmly and left undisturbed until next
spring. Two American flour bags placed
over the quilts will be quite enough extra
covering, or one of these stuffed with a little
dry barley straw will answer the purpose even
better, providing a warm covering over the
frames from two to three inches thick. An
inspection should be made of the roofs of the
hives, and if they are not thoroughly weather-proof,
two coats of good white-lead paint
should be applied to them. The size of the
entrance must not be reduced to less than
three inches.</p>

<p>The quieter bees are kept during the winter
the better they come out in the spring. Being
snowed up will not hurt them as long as they
get sufficient air to breathe, which they will do
through two or three feet of light snow. In the
middle of a warm day in February, when the
bees are flying freely, it will do no harm to lift a
corner of the quilts and take note of the amount
of sealed stores they still possess, if care be
taken not to expose and disturb them more than
is necessary. If they seem to be running short
of food, a box containing soft candy should be
given to them over the feed-hole. Feeding
liquid food would excite the bees too much so
early in the year, and it should not be done
until the beginning of April. If the stores are
almost exhausted, feeding with candy or syrup
will have to be kept up until the bees are able
to find enough honey in the fields to support
themselves. In some districts this may not be
until June. On the other hand, it is a mistake
to keep feeding our bees unless they really
require it.</p>

<p>March and April are often trying months for
the bees, the sudden changes of temperature
being very unfavourable to bee-life. Colonies
that are not very strong may become so reduced
in numbers that they “pull through” only
with difficulty, and afterwards require the whole
of the following season to regain their full
strength, yielding neither honey nor swarms.</p>

<p>On the other hand, strong colonies, under
favourable conditions, during the latter part of
April and May, will increase so rapidly that,
unless they are given plenty of room inside the
hive in good time, they will make preparations
for swarming, which the bee-keeper, who
wishes to work for honey and not swarm, will
find it difficult to check. The usual way to
give the bees more room in the spring is by
inserting a frame or foundation, or of empty
comb in the centre of the brood-nest. If,
however, the bees are not quite strong enough
to take it, and a spell of cold weather follows,
some of the brood may get chilled and this
will be a worse disaster than an over-crowded
hive.</p>

<p>The spring, then, is a period which calls for
constant attention and vigilance on the part of
the bee-keeper, who must not be satisfied, as
many are, that all is going on right because
the bees show activity on a warm day, but
must be acquainted with their exact condition,
so that prompt assistance may be given when
it is required.</p>

<p>Having completed my sketch of the chief
events in the bee-keeper’s calendar, it only
remains to add a few details which may be of
use or interest.</p>

<p>The subject of bee diseases is one that
claims our attention. There is only one serious
disease that bees are subject to; but that,
unfortunately, is rather common. It is known
as <i>foul brood</i>. It is caused by a micro-organism,
which attacks the brood in the
combs, causing it to putrefy and die. In its
earlier stages, the presence of foul brood can
only be detected by a careful examination of
the brood combs, in which here and there a
larva or two will be found to be decomposing
into a coffee-coloured ropy mass, and some of
the capped cells containing pupæ will have
their cappings sunken and perforated. As the
disease advances, much of the brood gets
affected, and a foul smell issues from the
entrance of the hive, which may often be perceived
several yards away. The colony becomes
rapidly weak and profitless, and in the
end frequently perishes altogether.</p>

<p>Foul brood is very contagious, and strong
measures must be taken to stamp it out directly
its presence is discovered. In a bad case
the whole colony must be burnt. If the hive
is a good one, it may be preserved, but then
it must be thoroughly disinfected by being
scalded and painted inside and out with
carbolic acid. When the disease is discovered
in an early stage the combs only
need be destroyed, the bees being shaken off
them and treated as a swarm. They should
be put into a new hive on frames of foundation,
and fed with syrup medicated with
Naphthol-beta. This drug is supplied in
packets by the principal dealers in bee-appliances,
and full directions for use are
printed on each packet. The old hive and
everything connected with the diseased colony
must be burnt or thoroughly disinfected. If
the combs contain much honey it may be
utilised for human consumption without fear;
but on no account must it be given back to
the bees. When fresh brood develops in the
new combs, a sharp look-out must be maintained
for the reappearance of the disease; if
it should manifest itself, in however slight a
degree, the operation of renewing hive and
combs must be gone through again. The
disease must be looked for in other hives, and
these, if found to be affected, must at once be
dealt with in a similar way. The source of
infection should be ascertained, and if it
be found that a neighbouring bee-keeper
has any diseased colonies, he should be persuaded
to take immediate steps to cure or
destroy them.</p>

<p>Bees do not suffer from the attacks of many
enemies in this country. Wasps are sometimes
troublesome around the hive entrances in the
autumn, and titmice are rather too fond of
making a meal on a bee or two in the winter.
The latter have an amusing way of bringing
the bees out of the hive by tapping with their
beaks on the alighting board, until a worker
appears to see what the matter is, for which
act it is immediately seized and swallowed.
Field-mice like honey, and will sometimes
play havoc with the combs of a weak colony;
but if the entrance is not more than 3/8 inch
deep, they will find it difficult to force a
passage in the hive.</p>

<p>The most troublesome pests, when they get
in the hives, are the caterpillars or the wax-moth.
They riddle the combs with their
numerous silk-lined tunnels, devouring all the
pollen brood and honey that come in their
way. It is difficult to get rid of these caterpillars
without destroying the combs. All
moths found in the quilts should be destroyed,
for they lay the eggs which produce the caterpillars.
The wax-moth is very destructive in
bee-hives in America, but one seldom hears of
its doing much damage in England, except in
badly-kept or neglected hives. Two balls of
naphthaline placed on the quilts will help to
keep the wax-moth away.</p>

<p>A curious parasite called the bee-louse
(<i>Branla cocca</i>) is sometimes found attached
to the body of the queen, and occasionally
also the workers. Though it belongs to the
order of flies, it is blind and wingless, and
most resembles a tiny reddish-brown spider.
A few of these parasites do not seem to
inconvenience the queen-bee.</p>

<p>Ants may be kept out of the hive by placing
the legs in saucers containing water. Earwigs
do no harm in the hive.</p>

<p>Experienced bee-keepers are often able to
increase their colonies cheaply in the autumn by
<i>driving</i> their neighbour’s bees. Unhappily
there are still many owners of bees in this
enlightened country to whom the hive is as a
sealed book that they have never attempted
to open. They do not trouble to look after
their bees, and, when wanting the honey,
would destroy them to obtain it, if some practical
bee-keeper did not come forward and offer
to do the work for them, asking to be allowed
to take the bees he has saved from destruction
in return for his services, a request which the
owner is generally willing enough to grant.
It requires a man of some little experience to
drive bees successfully, so we will not go into
the details of the operation here. Suffice it to
say that the straw hive or skep from which the
bees are to be driven is fixed in an inverted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_828"></a>{828}</span>
position, and another skep placed over it into
which the bees, by repeated rapping, are
driven. Driven bees can generally be bought
fairly cheaply in the autumn. Several lots of
driven bees should be put together into a
wooden hive provided with frames fitted with
foundation, or better still, ready drawn-out
combs if you have them. Rapid feeding must
then be commenced at once, and sufficient
food for winter stores should be taken down
and sealed over before the middle of
September.</p>

<p>We must not be surprised if our extracted
honey becomes opaque and solid on the
approach of cold weather. This process is
called candying or granulation, and is, in fact,
a proof of the purity of the honey, though
some kinds granulate much sooner than others.
Well-ripened honey, when granulated, will
keep good for years.</p>

<p>In concluding these papers a few words on
the natural history of bees may be of interest.
Some of my readers will be surprised when I
tell them that there are about two hundred
different kinds of bees to be found in England.
Up to the present I have been talking only
about one of these, and this one, properly
speaking, is a honey-bee. Almost all the
other bees are solitary in their habits, that is,
they do not live in large colonies in hives, but
singly or in pairs in holes in the ground, in old
stumps or walls, or in the hollow stems of
plants. Still they are, many of them, very
interesting, and well worth studying. They
all feed on honey, and may be found on
various kinds of flowers throughout the spring
and summer. Some of them are large and
beautiful like the well-known humble-bees;
others are small and inconspicuous. Some
resemble our honey-bee so closely that none
but an expert could tell them apart; others
again have such a strong likeness to wasps
that a novice would scarcely give them credit
for sweeter relationships.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i828b" style="max-width: 21.875em;">

  <div class="caption"><p class="center">QUEEN HUMBLE-BEE (<i>Bombus terrestris</i>).</p></div>
</div>

<p>But readers of this magazine, who happen
to reside abroad, might come across other
kinds of honey-bees, wild perhaps, but to
which, if put in hives, all the foregoing
remarks would more or less apply. Several
of the foreign races of the honey-bee have
been tried in this country and have been
found to do very well. One of these, the
Italian bee, is quite naturalised, and has
spread so extensively over the country that it
is hard to find a colony of pure English bees
now, most of our bees being a cross between
the English and the Italian races. Italian
bees may be readily recognised by the pale
semi-transparent, orange-yellow markings on
the tail, true English bees being entirely black
all over. The Italian bees are more prolific
than the English race and they are easier to
handle because they remain quietly on their
combs when the hive is opened. A good
cross between the English and Italian races is
generally acknowledged to be the best honey-bee
for all purposes in this country, but it
has acquired a name for being rather bad-tempered.</p>

<p>Books that will be helpful to those who are
“going in” for bee-keeping are <i>The British
Beekeeper’s Guide Book</i> (paper, 1s. 6d.),
and <i>Modern Bee-keeping</i> (6d.), published
by the British Bee-keepers’ Association.</p>

<p>Finally, the beginner must not be disheartened
by a few difficulties and failures.
They should, on the contrary, spur on to
greater efforts in seeking to avoid them in
the future, for it is chiefly by first failures that
experience, that most important factor in
every successful pursuit, is gained. Persistent
effort will bring its reward, and the bees will
soon become a greater source of interest than
we ever thought could be possible.</p>

<h3>PART IX.</h3>

<p class="ph3">THE TALL GIRL AND THE SMALL GIRL.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp79" id="i828a" style="max-width: 15.625em;">

</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Often</span> the
cockloft is empty
in those whom
Nature has built
many storeys
high,” says
quaint old Fuller.</p>

<p>“Long and
lazy,” says the
proverb.</p>

<p>“Divinely
tall,” says
Tennyson.</p>

<p>Now in thought go over the tall girls
whom you have known. Perhaps they
were not unlike the tall girls known to
me.</p>

<p>Cicely—by herself called Thithily—is one of
these. She has a little head atop of a long
body, and when she laughs, which she does
much, displays to view two rows of foolishly
small teeth. Cicely laughs to keep herself
from crying, for she has a very hard time of it.</p>

<p><i>Poor?</i></p>

<p>No. She has everything that money can
buy, but lacks a thing that money cannot
buy.</p>

<p>Muriel is the poor long girl known to me.</p>

<p>Muriel’s wail is, <i>There is so much of me to
dress</i>.</p>

<p>When last I saw Muriel, her boots were
down at heel, and to shamefacedness she added—shamefootedness.</p>

<p>Dearest to me of long girls is one Dorothy,
big and beautiful and kind, knowing some
things—not many—and wanting to know
more.</p>

<p>Said Dorothy one day—</p>

<p>“Is there not such a word as ‘magnanimosity’
for ‘kindness’?”</p>

<p>It was hard to have to tell her that there
was not, and that, if ever such a word as
“magnanimosity” shall be, it will certainly
not be a word for “kindness.”</p>

<p>Have you noticed that a big girl mostly has
a small girl for her friend, and <i>vice versâ</i>?
Shakespeare, who noticed all things, noticed
that. With Helena he puts Hermia, and with
Rosalind Celia.</p>

<p>The tall girls of prose-fiction are numerous.
For <i>A</i> there is Blackmore’s Annie, who “never
tried to look away when honest people gazed
at her.” For <i>B</i> there is Thackeray’s Beatrix,
and there is one for every other letter in the
alphabet.</p>

<p>The “towering big” girl—to put the matter
Hibernically—had a great vogue a few years
ago as the heroine of <i>Trilby</i>, but, on the
whole, the small girl has been more singled out
for loving treatment by novelists than the tall
girl. Dickens had a known preference for
her, and his “little Nell” has eclipsed all big
Nells. In the description of one Ruth, too,
it may be noticed that he uses with loving
iteration the word “little”—“pleasant little
Ruth! cheerful, tidy, bustling, quiet little
Ruth!”</p>

<p>In fiction subsequent to that of Dickens
there is a Mary described thus—“a
little dumpty body, with a
yellow face and a red nose, the
smile of an angel, and a heart
full of many little secrets of
other people’s, and of one great
one of her own, which is no
business of any man’s.”</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp31" id="i828c" style="max-width: 7.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_828c.jpg"  alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">A
Tall
Story</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>All readers of Kingsley’s <i>Two
Years Ago</i> will remember that
Mary.</p>

<p>The poets no less than the
prose-writers have busied themselves
with the small girl. The
mere word <i>Duchess</i> to most
people calls up a picture of stateliness, yet
Browning describes a duchess as follows:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“She was the smallest lady alive.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In these days of tall girls small girls are apt
to fret. There is one known to me whose
case is pitifuller than that of the little fir-tree
in Andersen.</p>

<p>That little fir-tree, you
will remember, thought of
nothing so much as growing.
The children sitting beside
it would often exclaim, “How
pretty and little it is!” <i>It
could not bear to hear that</i>,
says Andersen.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp36" id="i828d" style="max-width: 9.375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_828d.jpg"  alt="" />
  <div class="caption">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right"><span class="smcap">Ben Jonson</span></div>
</div>
</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The case of the little girl
known to me is just by so
much sadder than that of the
little fir-tree that she knows
that her growing days are
over. When last I saw her
she was trying to give length
to herself by a long tail to her
dress, but the world was not deluded thus,
and measured her, as naturalists measure the
mouse, “not including the tail.”</p>

<p>Happily a major number of small girls still
carry a high heart, knowing that maids, as
well as men, may be “little, very little, but
not insignificant.”</p>

<p>Those words are Sir Walter Scott’s in
reference to Thomas Moore, whose pseudonym,
it may be remembered, was at one time
Thomas Little.</p>

<p>This is perhaps the place in which to say
a word about the persons whose littleness is
bound up with their fame. One of the greatest
generals of all time had for his best known
soubriquet “the little corporal.” Omit the
“little” in that case, and the appellation is
robbed of all that gives piquancy to it.</p>

<p>How much there may be in the mere word<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_829"></a>{829}</span>
“little” is shown in the following—true—story.</p>

<p>A living sculptor of note, a foreigner residing
in London, made a tender group composed of
a mother and her child. The mother was
counting the baby’s toes, and beneath the
group was carved a legend
which the artist conceived
to embody a familiar nursery
rhyme. The legend
ran, “One pig went to
market.”</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp34" id="i829a" style="max-width: 14.0625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_829a.jpg"  alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="center"><i>Ah, von leettle peeg—oui,
oui!</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>“Sir, sir!” remonstrated
an Irishwoman, to whose
inspection the group was
subjected, “you’ve made a
terrible omission. You’ve
left out ‘little.’ No human
mother would sing to her
babe, ‘One pig went to
market.’”</p>

<p>The foreign sculptor beat
his breast.</p>

<p>The ironical use of big for small and small
for big is a thing of old custom. Thus one of
the biggest English Johns who ever lived was
known to his contemporaries, and is still
known to those who cherish his memory, as
Little John, and it is by a similar pleasantry,
according to a learned writer, that Maria, who
in Shakespeare’s play of <i>Twelfth Night</i> is
represented as <i>a little woman</i>, is called by
Viola “Olivia’s giant,” and that Sir Toby says
to her “Good-night, Penthesilea,” meaning
by Penthesilea <i>amazon</i>, if his meaning was
not merely (and to me this seems to be the
more likely thing) to twit the little woman by
giving her a long name.</p>

<p>Indubitably there is a beauty in tall stature.
On the other hand the case of small girls
<i>versus</i> tall girls is in one agreeable respect
analogous to that of ants <i>versus</i> elephants.
Though an ant is not the smallest creature
that is, it looks very small beside an elephant;
yet it has long been voted mentally superior
to the elephant; in fact, Coleridge was wont to
speak of the ant as the most “intellectual” of
animals. That may be so, or may not be so;
it is established fact, however, that the majority
of women who have distinguished themselves
by their intellectuality have been little women.
This is true of the poetesses, from Sappho to
Elizabeth Barrett Browning. Among women-writers
of imaginative prose it would be easy,
but would be invidious, to name living ones.
Of the great dead it is enough to name
Charlotte Brontë and Jane Austen, both of
them little women.</p>

<p>Among the many women who have distinguished
themselves as rulers Queen Elizabeth
made good in high dignity what she
lacked in high stature, and the same thing is
true of the queen who to-day occupies the
throne of England.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i829b" style="max-width: 21.875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_829b.jpg"  alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">TWO GREAT LITTLE QUEENS</p></div>
</div>

<p>To give one more instance of the great in
the little, it was a little woman who worked
the prison reforms which make the name of
Elizabeth Fry a deathless one. The list of
great little women is indeed very long.</p>

<p>A word must be said here in reference to
a charge much levelled at small persons,
especially small girls and women. They have
been said to be unduly self-assertive, and
their sisters have been praised for their superior
meekness. It is not always, but it is sometimes,
the case of the high holly branches and
the low. The high holly branches put out no
prickles, because, as the botanists explain, they
do not need them. Above a certain height
there is no danger of attack.</p>

<p>In fairness to tall girls it must be allowed
that they are sometimes attacked. Said a little
Irishman to a big English
girl whom he met under
the stars one summer
night—</p>

<p>“I’m wantin’ to light
me pipe, miss. <i>Will ye
kindly hand me down a
star?</i>”</p>

<p>The nonplussed English
girl was silent, and Pat
the saucy went on his way
unpunished.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp41" id="i829c" style="max-width: 12.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_829c.jpg"  alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">The

</div>

<p>Gentleness and bigness
often go together, but lest
any long Meg who may
chance to read this paper
lay the too-flattering unction to her soul that
there was never shrew that was bigger than
a mouse, be it here set down that the famous
Long Meg of Westminster was a dreaded
virago. There is also no reason to believe
that the shrew of Shakespeare’s comedy—the
lady ironically styled “the kindest Kate”—was
of small body dimensions.</p>

<p>It may be allowed, however, that vehemence
is more often a distinguishing mark of little
persons than of big ones. Similarly, little
persons are, as a rule, more prone to indulge in
a scornful vein, and here there shall be a thing
whispered to the small girl. The tall are rarely
so contemptuous to the small as the small are
to the—smaller. This appears to have been so
from of old. Thus it was, according to an old
Greek fable, the ant that said of the mite when
the beasts—including the elephant and the
whale—were summoned before Jupiter, that
she—the mite—was so small as to be beneath
notice. This objection—coming from the ant—must
have surprised the elephant and the
whale.</p>

<p>To conclude. Since (as the proverb has it)
they are not all big men who reap the harvest,
and since, equally, they are not all small men
who do this, the thing of main importance
would appear to be not a man’s physical
height; and, as is the case with men in this
matter, so is, it may safely be assumed, the
case with the daughters of men.</p>

<p class="center">[THE END.]</p>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">By</span> “THE NEW DOCTOR.”</p>


<h3>PART III.</h3>

<p class="ph3">THE DINNER.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> what time do you dine? Dinner is the
chief physiological event in the day. Therefore
the answer to the question “At what
time do you dine?” is a very important one,
although the true reason for the answer is not
often understood.</p>

<p>There are really but two ways of arranging
the day’s meals; the one, the more rational,
we may call the French way; the other, the
less rational, we may call the English
labourer’s way. The first arrangement is
carried out by nearly every nation except
ourselves. It consists in a very light breakfast,
a fair meal after noon, and the chief meal
in the evening.</p>

<p>The second arrangement consists of a fair
breakfast, the chief meal at about one o’clock,
and a small meal in the evening.</p>

<p>And then there is our own, the irrational
method of feeding—a big breakfast, a scrap
for lunch, and the dinner in the evening.</p>

<p>But if this division of meals is not
physiologically correct, why do we adhere
to it?</p>

<p>The answer to this is that we choose the
least harmful of several very wrong methods.
The man in the middle class in England does
not apportion out for himself any definite
time for meals; if he did not dine in the
evening, he would never properly digest any
meal. Take a busy City man, for instance.
He arranges his time in such a manner that
he swallows down his last teaspoonful of tea
at breakfast about a quarter of a second before
he runs to catch his train. If it were not that
he has to keep still while in the train, he would
never digest his meal at all.</p>

<p>And then he rushes out of his office to
snatch a bit of lunch between two items of
business. He may play a game of chess over his
lunch, but such a gross waste of time as
sitting down for five minutes after his meal is
never tolerated until he becomes a martyr to
dyspepsia.</p>

<p>But after dinner he does rest, because he
has nothing else to do. His business for the
day is over, and he digests his meal in peace.</p>

<p>But with the working-classes the case is
very different. They have certain hours given
to them for their meals, during which time
they are not allowed to work, and for such
persons it is advisable to dine in the middle of
the day.</p>

<p>It would be of little good for us to describe
the few advantages and overwhelming abuses
of a sumptuous banquet, for, most fortunately
for themselves, extremely few of our readers
are ever likely to be present at one. Nor
would it suit our purpose to describe a one-course
dinner, so we will take the chief meal
of a well-to-do man of the upper middle-class
as the subject of our remarks.</p>

<p>Here is the menu:—</p>


<ul class="center"><li>Tomato Soup.</li>
<li>Turbot and Lobster Sauce.</li>
<li>Mutton Cutlets and Tomatoes.</li>
<li>Roast Ribs of Beef. Horse-radish.</li>
<li>Spinach. Potatoes.</li>
<li>Cabinet Pudding.</li>
<li>Caviare on Toast.</li>
<li>Coffee.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will first criticise the dinner as a whole
and then dilate separately upon each item.</p>

<p>In the first place the meal is much too long.
Dinner should never last more than half an
hour, whereas this meal will take a full hour
at least.</p>

<p>The second point is a most important one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_830"></a>{830}</span>
and one which is frequently overlooked, yet it
is one of the most important causes of ill-health.
It is this. There are six courses in
this dinner, and every one of them contains
animal food. Every item in the list is a
concentrated food, rich in nourishment, and
readily digestible. Consequently nearly the
whole of what is eaten will get into the blood,
and there, being greatly in excess of what is
needed, it will irritate the organs by which it
must be got rid of.</p>

<p>One word about the drinks. The stomach
of man is made to digest solids, and one of
the most fertile causes of indigestion is taking
excess of fluids with meals. Drinking
between meals or when the stomach is empty
is not such an important cause of indigestion
as is drinking largely with meals, because
drinking large quantities dilutes the gastric
secretion, which loses its digestive power if
freely diluted.</p>

<p>At no meal should more than half a pint of
fluid be taken, and that is best taken at the
end of the repast.</p>

<p>The pernicious habit of serving different
wines with each course is one of the most
harmful customs of modern dieting. If you
have wine at all, have light wines only, and
never change the drinks with the various
courses.</p>

<p>Of course, the dinner we are criticising is
excellently served and there is no waiting
between the courses. But when people whose
purses are strictly limited give dinners, they
are not content with an ordinary two-course
meal, but must ape the doings of their more
wealthy neighbours and give elaborate dinners,
which for obvious reasons are badly served.</p>

<p>Waiting between the courses of a meal is
very injurious to the stomach. A little wait
after the soup does no harm at all. Soup is
more a digestive stimulant than a food, and
therefore it is advisable to wait a little between
the soup and the next course. But after that
there should be no delay, and the meal should
be finished as soon as possible.</p>

<p>There are thirty persons sitting down to this
dinner, and we notice that they have all washed
their hands. Here is the first thing that we
should all do well to copy. Everybody should
wash her hands before sitting down to a meal.
Don’t laugh and say that everybody does do
so! We know such is not the case, and it is
just those persons for whom it is most
necessary to wash before eating who neglect
this hygienic measure.</p>

<p>Workers in factories, especially those who
have to work with lead or other poisonous
materials, should be scrupulously careful never
to touch food with dirty hands. Neglect of this
precaution is the commonest method by which
chronic poisoning is produced.</p>

<p>Legislation has been doing all in its power
to limit the deleterious effects of poisons upon
those who are compelled to work in them.
Yet it is exceedingly difficult to get factory
workers to wash their hands before eating,
and many firms have been severely censured
when cases of chronic poisoning have occurred
in their works, when the sufferers themselves
were entirely to blame because they would not
wash their hands.</p>

<p>To return to the dinner. At the table,
soups are divided into two groups—thick and
clear. Dietetically, the division is extremely
well marked, for the actions and uses of the
two are totally different.</p>

<p>Clear soup—that is, soup which is quite free
from floating particles—is not a food and
contains no nourishment. This may seem a
strong statement to make and you may disbelieve
it; but still it is a fact. Clear soup is
a solution of the <i>débris</i> of animal tissue. The
nourishing part of animal flesh is insoluble in
boiling water and therefore is not present in
clear soup. The only fluid which contains
nutritive animal matter after it has been boiled
is milk.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> But if it is not a food, clear soup is
a powerful stimulant and is a good opening to
a big meal. But it should only be taken in
very small quantities, and by most persons
beyond middle age it is better not taken at all!</p>

<p>Thick soup is a nutritious preparation owing
its nourishing power entirely to the solid
particles suspended in it. Like clear soup,
however, it is chiefly a solution of animal
<i>débris</i>—the waste products of life.</p>

<p>It used to be the rule to give beef-tea and
other meat extractives in all illnesses, but
fortunately the custom is dying out as our
knowledge increases. There are many diseases—for
instance, gout—which are due to excess
of waste products in the blood; or, to put it
in an intelligible form, they are due to
substances identical with beef-tea circulating
in the blood. And yet these people used to
be fed on soup, when of all things in the
world it is that which they should avoid.</p>

<p>Before we continue the dinner, we wish to
say a few words about this custom of giving
beef-teas, etc., to invalids. The ordinary
soups, beef-teas, meat essences and suchlike,
which are commonly given to the sick, are
inappropriate for their purpose and are
frequently exceedingly injurious. You cannot
feed anybody on beef-tea. It is a fairly useful
stimulant, but as a food it is worthless. But
you can make a liquid food which contains a
considerable part of the nourishment of meat
and is, moreover, not indigestible.</p>

<p>Meat-juice is the fluid obtained by squeezing
raw beef. If you hang up a large piece of
raw meat, a reddish opalescent liquid will drop
from it. This is raw meat-juice and is
practically a solution of blood albumen. It is
exceedingly nutritious and is very useful in
many kinds of disease. It is frequently ordered
nowadays by physicians. It must be made
only from beef which you are perfectly certain
is quite sound. There is really danger in
giving this meat-juice or raw meat of any kind,
and a girl must be pretty certain of her butcher
before she attempts to give it to an invalid.</p>

<p>Another less unpleasant way of making the
same or nearly the same preparation is the
following. Take a pound of rump steak and
shred it up with a knife. Put it into warm
water and let it digest in a very cool oven for
four hours. You must be certain that the oven
never reaches a temperature above 160° F.,
for at about twenty degrees above this
albumen coagulates, and instead of meat-juice
you will only have beef-tea. After the
preparation has been in the oven for four
hours, take it out and strain it.</p>

<p>When you are feeding an invalid, a time in
convalescence arrives when the patient wants
the nourishment of meat, but cannot digest so
solid a substance as beef or mutton. Then
you can give her the following broth—</p>

<p>Take half a pound of the best rump steak,
and having shredded it up finely, boil it in a
pint of water for four hours, and then press
the whole through a sieve. If necessary or
desirable, vegetables may be added, or chicken
may be used in place of beef. The great point
to remember in making this is to press everything
through the sieve. This forms the most
nourishing of all liquids; yet it is not liquid
nourishment, for the nutritive portion exists in
the solid particles which float about in the
liquid.</p>

<p>The fish course is usually a very digestible
one. On the whole, boiled fish is more
digestible than fried fish, and may be given to
invalids earlier in convalescence. Boiled sole
is the most readily digested of all fish, but
with the exception of herrings, mackerel,
salmon, eel, and some other fresh-water fish,
all fish is good wholesome food. The fish
mentioned as being indigestible must never be
given to anybody whose stomach is in any way
delicate or readily upset.</p>

<p>Excepting oysters, all shellfish are indigestible.
Mussels have always had an unfair
amount of abuse. It is true that they cause
more deaths than any other kind of shellfish,
but then they are eaten in much larger
quantities. No shellfish should ever be eaten
raw, for they all feed on carrion and filth
of very description, and so may contain large
numbers of very virulent germs.</p>

<p>It is well to remember that fish is meat
diet. People make absurd mistakes about
this, and look upon fish as part of a milk
diet. Fish has essentially the same composition
as butcher’s meat, but it contains more
water and fewer extractives.</p>

<p>It is well known to everybody that the
medical profession has for ages urged upon
the public the dangers of excessive flesh-eating,
yet has it never clearly stated why eating too
much meat is so far more injurious than eating
too much bread or vegetables. But the
explanation is really very simple.</p>

<p>Meat is more readily soluble and digestible
than farinaceous foods. If you fill your
stomach with meat, all of it will be digested;
practically the whole of it will get into the
blood, and there being in excess of what is
needed, it gives the various organs of the body
great trouble to get rid of it.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you take a big meal
of cabbage, only a very small proportion of it
is digestible, and so very little will get into
the blood. After eating excess of vegetables
or farinaceous food you will probably be sick,
and there is an end of the matter.</p>

<p>But besides nourishment, meat contains a
large quantity of extractives—substances which
are waste products of vital action; which are
practically animal poisons, and which enter
the blood without requiring digestion, but
which are useless to the animal economy, and
have to be got rid of at once.</p>

<p>It is to extractives that meats owe their
flavour, and the more tasty and succulent your
dishes are, the greater is the amount of
extractives that they contain.</p>

<p>It is in the <i>entrée</i> that meat flavourings are
carried to their highest pitch, and it is the
<i>entrée</i> which is usually the most harmful
course at the dinner.</p>

<p>If the <i>entrée</i> were discarded in favour of a
vegetable course, it would indeed be a blessing.
If you have <i>entrées</i> at all, let them be absolutely
simple, such as the one which has been
chosen for our specimen dinner.</p>

<p>You may be surprised when we say that
meat is more digestible than farinaceous food,
and yet that when treating dyspepsia we avoid
meat as far as possible. But the apparent
contradiction is readily dispelled.</p>

<p>Indigestion is usually due to disease of the
stomach, and failure of its power for digestion.
Meat is digested practically only in the
stomach; farinaceous foods are not digested
in the stomach, but lower down in the alimentary
canal. It is only when indigestion is
due to failure of the stomach that it is benefited
by the avoidance of meat. In many
forms of dyspepsia a farinaceous diet gives the
greatest trouble of all.</p>

<p>Of the joint we will say nothing at present.
Horse-radish is a good aromatic digestive
stimulant. It used to be used much more
frequently than it is, because of its anti-scorbutic
properties.</p>

<p>Not many years ago a whole dinner-party
was poisoned by eating aconite root in mistake
for horse-radish. Nor has this accident
happened but once; many cases of poisoning
in this way have been recorded. And it is a
very terrible thing, for a little aconite root
may kill a dozen persons at a time. Aconite
root is the root of the blue monk’s-hood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_831"></a>{831}</span>
(<i>Aconitum Napellus</i>), one of our native
English plants. It is rare in the wild state,
but is frequently grown in gardens for the sake
of its fine spikes of dark blue blossoms. How
the aconite root can be mistaken for horse-radish
we cannot quite see, for the poisonous
root is carrot-shaped, rarely more than three
inches long, almost scentless, and with a bitter
“mawkish” taste. The smallest quantity of
the root produces, when chewed, tingling,
followed by prolonged numbness of the tongue
and cheeks. All parts of the monk’s-hood are
extremely poisonous, but the root is the most
deadly part.</p>

<p>And now for a few words about vegetables,
the most neglected, yet one of the most
important food-stuffs.</p>

<p>It is impossible to over-estimate the value
of the potato as an article of diet. Alone it
is not a good food, but it is the ideal vegetable
to have with meat.</p>

<p>An Irishman asked a companion to dinner,
and in answer to the question as to the fare,
replied, “Just an illigant pace of corned bafe
and pertaters.” To which his friend replied,
“My own dinner to a tay, barring the bafe.”
Let us hope that he accepted the invitation,
for corned beef and potatoes make a good,
if rough, meal, but potatoes alone are not
sufficient.</p>

<p>It has been questioned by many persons if
the introduction of the potato has proved an
advantage, for it has driven out the older
vegetables, such as salsify and celeriac. But
if we look upon the potato merely in the light
of a usurper of the place formerly occupied
by other vegetables, we must still consider it
as an immense boon to mankind.</p>

<p>That the potato is not very easily digested
we grant, and it should be avoided by the
subjects of dyspepsia. But in the dietary of
perfectly healthy persons, the digestibility of
the food is of secondary importance to that of
over-strong and rich food. For as we have
over and over again said, the great fault in
modern diet is not that we eat too much, but
that we take our food too strong.</p>

<p>All vegetables, especially spinach and
Brussels sprouts, have lately been shown to
produce marked improvement in gouty
conditions; and experimental evidence has
proved that their action upon gout is a definite
chemical one. That gout is often in some
way connected with an excessive meat diet
has long been known, but it is not even now
certain what it is in meat which tends to cause
gout. But that the condition is markedly
benefited by a vegetable diet, there is no
question. The only difficulty in applying this
observation to practice—and it is a real
difficulty, although enthusiasts will persist in
shutting their eyes to it—is that a vegetable
diet is far more difficult to digest than a
meat diet, and gouty persons are frequently
dyspeptic.</p>

<p>Sweets served after dinner should always be
simple. Stewed fruit, cabinet puddings,
farinaceous or milk puddings, or pancakes,
etc.; but not rich plum puddings or highly
flavoured concoctions of any kind. Rich
sweets are worse than rich <i>entrées</i>, for besides
being equally rich in extractives, they are
exceedingly indigestible.</p>

<p>The question as to whether ices and iced
water are good to take with dinner is worth a
moment’s consideration.</p>

<p>In very small quantities iced water is the
best of all fluids to take with dinner, but the
quantity taken should be very small. And
the same is true of ices. A very little ice
after dinner helps digestion, but a large
quantity seriously injures the stomach.</p>

<p>Coffee in small quantities is a digestive
stimulant. If taken it should be drunk
immediately the dinner is completed.</p>

<p>Having thoroughly considered the subject,
we have come to the decided conclusion
that by far the best dinner for those who can
afford it, with very few exceptions, is one of
two courses. The first course to consist of
light fish <i>with vegetables</i>, or a very simple
<i>entrée with vegetables</i>; and the second to
consist of a joint of meat or some equivalent
also <i>with vegetables</i>. This may be followed
by a simple sweet or savoury.</p>

<p>Also, we believe that the average person
does not eat too much, but that she takes too
much meat, far too much extractives, and too
little vegetable.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Girls’ Employments.</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother’s Help.</span>—“<i>I am twenty-six, and
for the last six years have occupied, at a
very small salary, a situation—or rather three
situations—as mother’s help. I am heartily
tired of being neither one thing nor another,
and wish I knew some way of qualifying
myself for some less wearing and more
remunerative work. I have thought of
entering the Norland Institute to be trained
for a children’s nurse, but I fear I am not
well enough educated. Typewriting I have
also considered, as that would leave me the
evenings free for study. I should be willing
to spend a little time and money on some sort
of training.</i>—<span class="smcap">Perplexed.</span>”</p>

<p>Our correspondent has come to a most
sensible decision, and we wish that some of
our readers could profit by her experience
that such positions as those of mother’s help,
useful companion, etc., are “neither one thing
nor another.” “Perplexed” tells us in her
letter, which we have not published in its
entirety, that she understands the management
of children, and can make their clothes
well. Under these circumstances it seems to
us that she hardly needs to undergo a full
course of training to become a children’s
nurse. But what she lacks at present is some
knowledge of the treatment a baby requires,
and some general experience of infantile
ailments and their cure. As “Perplexed”
lives in Scotland we would suggest that she
should try to obtain by payment some short
course of training in a hospital of a special
character. The Glasgow Maternity Hospital,
37, North Portland Street, Glasgow, offers an
arrangement which might suit the case.
Pupils are received for a course of sixteen
weeks for £13 13s. 6d. This pays all
expenses except laundry and uniform.
Possessed of such experience as this, and
having been in attendance on children before,
“Perplexed” ought to obtain some fairly well
paid situation as children’s nurse to begin
with, and could then avoid the disagreeableness
of having to commence life again as an
under-nurse. If Edinburgh suited “Perplexed”
better, the Royal Maternity Hospital,
79, Lauriston Place, might advisably be selected.
Here a course of three months’ training at a
cost of £11 10s. may be entered upon on the
first day of February, May, August or
November in each year. Pupils have the
advantage of attending lectures. Training
in a children’s hospital would no doubt be
preferable, because the patients would be
children of all ages, but “Perplexed” could
hardly enter any such institution for less than
three years, and the number of applicants at
these favourite hospitals is always very great.
Typewriting we do not advise to “Perplexed”
as it seems to us that she has many practical
accomplishments which are in constant request
among employers. She would therefore do
better as a nurse or in some other capacity
in a private household.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Photography.</span>—1. “<i>Do any well-known
West End photographers take girls as articled
pupils? About what premium do they require?
I know very little about it, but I have
had a camera for a year. I suppose it is a
profession for girls which is not at present
overcrowded.</i>—2. <i>Would it be wise for me to
take a diploma at one of the Schools of
Cookery? Would cookery or photography be
the more expensive to learn, and which would
pay best in the end? I like both photography
and cooking, but prefer the former.</i>—<span class="smcap">A
would-be Photographer.</span>”</p>

<p>1. Several firms, and notably those conducted
by ladies, take girls as apprentices. A premium
of not less than £30 is usually asked,
and sometimes no payment is given for two
years. In other cases, part of the premium is
returnable in salary at an earlier date. Girls
are usually employed as “spotters and finishers”
of the prints, and earn in this manner
from 10s. to £1 a week. An ambitious clever
girl ought not, however, to be content to do
this kind of work always, but should try to do
the retouching of negatives, a business by
which from £100 to £300 a year may be
earned. We have found that there is a considerable
demand also for girls who can paint
magic lantern slides; and altogether there
are many ways by which a girl who understands
photography can earn a sufficient
livelihood.</p>

<p>2. To take a diploma at a school of cookery
would not occupy so long as learning photography
nor would it be so expensive. The
length of the course at the principal schools
varies from six to fifteen months, ten months
or a year being usual. The cost ranges from
nine guineas, charged at Leicester, to thirty
guineas, the full cost of the course at the
National Training School of Cookery in
London. The Liverpool and Manchester
schools—both of which are excellent—charge
twelve guineas for courses of nine and eight
months respectively. Cookery teacherships
are pretty well paid, the salaries varying from
£50 to £80 per annum, but they are not easy
to obtain. As daily cooks or cooks in private
households, where ladies are employed, a
woman with a knowledge of cookery can
always do well. But to compare photography
with cookery is almost impossible, and the
desirability of one occupation or the other can
best be determined by a girl’s own aptitude.</p>

<h3>MEDICAL.</h3>

<div class="blockquot_ans">

<p><span class="smcap">An Anglo-Indian.</span>—It is not necessary for Englishmen
to eat as much in India as they do in England,
and the reason for this is very easy to explain. We
eat to produce energy. That energy is of two
kinds—heat and work. Four-fifths of the energy
of an Englishman in England—four-fifths of what
he eats—produce heat, one-fifth only produces
work. The normal temperature of the body is
98.6° F. If we lived in a constant temperature of
98.6° F., it would be unnecessary for the body to
produce heat at all, and so four-fifths of its energy
would be saved. Therefore if man had been constructed
to live in a temperature of 98.6° F., he
would only require one-fifth of his ordinary diet.
But even in the hottest countries the body does
produce heat, because it is its nature to do so; but
it has to dispose of that heat at once, because the
temperature of the body in health is constant. In
very hot countries the body has to keep itself
cooler than the surrounding air—it has to dispose
of more heat than it produces. It is therefore not
difficult to understand why persons in hot countries
need, and should take, considerably less food than
those in England; and, conversely, the inhabitants
of cold countries require a very liberal diet. Also,
that Europeans in a hot country require more
food than the natives, because the bodies of the
latter have learnt, through many generations, not
to produce so much excessive heat as the bodies of
the Europeans who are “green” to the climate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Karamea.</span>—1. To cure corns, first wash your feet
in hot water and soap and leave them soaking for
fifteen minutes. Then take them out of the water;
thoroughly dry them and paint the corn with
“solvent.” You must not let the solvent touch
the surrounding skin. The solvent is made by
mixing together salicylic acid, twenty grains;
tincture of Indian hemp, five drops; alcohol, two
drams; and collodion to the ounce. Paint the
corn with this preparation every evening for some
days, until the corn drops off. With very hard
corns the treatment may take some weeks, but we
have never known it to fail, and it is absolutely
safe.—2. The sensation of a hand or foot going to
sleep is almost always due to pressure upon a
nerve, such as occurs from sitting on a hard chair
for many minutes at a time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Curious.</span>—Yawning is a deep and prolonged inspiration
(drawing air into the lungs). It occurs commonly
when the person is too tired or too lazy to
breathe properly. Cough is a sudden spasmodic
expiration (forcing air out of the lungs) with the
mouth open, following a deep inspiration. During
coughing the glottis (the slit through which the air
has to pass in order to enter or leave the lungs) is
closed at first and then opened. Cough is the
natural and only method of clearing the lungs.
Sneezing is a short, sudden expiration following a
deep inspiration with the mouth shut. Its object
is to clear the nose from something “tickling” it.
Hiccough is an irregular involuntary expiration
usually due to irritation of the lungs by a stomach
distended with gas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">An Inquiring Sister.</span>—Your brother is indeed unfortunate,
for the condition of his face is one which
is most difficult to eradicate. The disease is
known as “sycosis,” and often follows the use of
a razor which has been inoculated with very
virulent germs. Abroad all barbers are compelled
to disinfect their razors after using them, and this
disease is consequently less common than it is
with us. In England a careless barber shaves
one man with some skin disease and very often
communicates the disease to his next customer.
The disease is, as we said, a very chronic one.
The only treatment which ever completely cures it
is to pick out every hair in the beard and moustache—not
all at once, but only those which have
pustules at their roots. This is not such a painful
undertaking as it reads, for the hairs are loose and
come out easily. The face should afterwards be
covered with sulphur ointment. It is a formidable
disease and needs careful and energetic treatment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eileen.</span>—The best treatment for warts is to wash the
hand thoroughly with soap and hot water and
leave the hand soaking for ten minutes. Then dry
the hand and surround the wart with vaseline.
The vaseline is to protect the healthy skin from the
caustic, and must not be placed upon the wart
itself. Now drop one drop of glacial acetic acid
upon the wart, leave it a couple of minutes and
then drop on another drop of the acid. Finally
rub the wart all over with a stick of nitrate of
silver (lunar caustic). This treatment may have to
be repeated. Warts are usually due to irritation
of the skin. They are practically the same thing
as corns.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Girl of Twenty.</span>—It is difficult to be certain
what causes your baldness, but probably it is
“alopœcia areata.” But if it is this, it has existed
for a considerably longer time than is usual. We
advise you to paint the bald spots with tincture of
iodine every day until the places feel slightly sore.
As soon as this occurs, leave off the treatment till
the places become well again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Suffolk Bunny.</span>—The condition of your face is
analogous to chaps on the hands. It is caused by
rough winds. Always wear a veil when you go
out in a cold wind. A little glycerine and rose-water,
or glycerine and lime-water, or a very little
cold cream will relieve the roughness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bonne.</span>—The pneumonia which follows influenza is
of a most fatal character, and the majority of
subjects attacked never recover. In January-March,
1895, pneumonia was a very common
complication of the influenza which was then
exceedingly prevalent. We believe that at that
time every single patient attacked with this complication
died. Now, although very serious, the
presence of pneumonia and influenza together is
by no means hopeless. The pneumonia in these
cases is not a separate disease, but is a manifestation
of the influenzal poison. There are three
broad types of influenza: that which chiefly affects
the lungs; that which mainly attacks the digestive
organs; and the type in which the nervous system
bears the chief brunt of the affection. Usually, in
one epidemic, one type chiefly prevails, although
all may occur. In 1894-1895 the respiratory type
of the disease was most prevalent; in 1895-1896
the nervous type; in 1896-1898 the digestive type
was most prevalent. And, so far, this year the
respiratory type is having another innings. Influenza
is a most serious disease, and its death-rate
is extremely high; but a very large number of
complaints put down to influenza have no connection
whatever with that disease. As a rule,
when a person says that she has had “a slight
touch of influenza,” she means either that she has
had a common head-cold or else that she has
given herself indigestion from trying to feed herself
up as a preventive against influenza!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morleena K.</span>—You are quite right to have your
rupture operated upon, for it is the only way to
cure it, and to go about with a rupture untreated is
one of the greatest possible physical dangers. Any
surgeon is competent to perform the operation, for
though it is not very easy, still he must have seen
so many “radical cures of hernia” performed as
to be thoroughly capable of performing the operation
himself. Although in former times the
operation was a very fatal one, ill-effects rarely
follow nowadays, and cure usually results. But
occasionally the rupture does recur. Surgery is
always expensive, unfortunately; but any person
who cannot afford to have an operation performed
upon her by a private surgeon can obtain proper
treatment at a hospital. We fully understand that
there are objections to going to a hospital to be
treated, but with most persons it is the only chance
they possess of obtaining the benefits of surgery.
We think it is our duty to remind you and others
who obtain hospital relief that you must contribute
towards the support of the institution, and that if
you obtain treatment in a hospital which would
have cost you £30 in private, you must not think
that you have done your duty by putting half-a-crown
into the box.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Working Woman.</span>—Before you marry you should
ask your intended husband to insure himself against
accidents. There are many clubs in every town
which a working man can join, and by paying a
few pence weekly obtain so much a week when he
is incapacitated by illness or accident. Most
working men do this, and considering how liable
they are to be disabled for a time, it is only right
that they should insure themselves before marrying.
In hospital practice if a patient does not belong to
a club, the usual reason is either that he is single or
else that he has once belonged to a club, the
treasurer of which bolted. Unfortunately this is a
very common method of swindling, but if a man
looks out for a thoroughly well-going company
and pays a reasonable premium he may feel fairly
sure of getting his money if he should become
incapable of work. If your husband does not
belong to a club, what are you to do if he breaks
his arm or his leg, an accident to which he is
particularly liable?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Please help me.</span>—One teaspoonful of Eau de
Cologne to every four ounces of water. Sponge
the hands with this preparation. You must not
use soap with Eau de Cologne.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peggie.</span>—Perhaps it would be better to tell you how
to prevent chilblains first, before going on to
describe how they can be cured. Always wash
your hands in warm water, and use a good toilet
soap. After washing, dry your hands well. Always
wear woollen gloves throughout the winter, and,
lastly, try by general hygienic measures to improve
your circulation. When the chilblains first begin
to show, sponge the fingers with equal parts of
spirit and water, or apply a little tincture of
benzoin, and wrap the hands up in cotton-wool.
By these measures you may prevent the chilblains
from bursting. If, in spite of all precautions, the
chilblains do break, they should be treated as any
other kind of open wound. Above all, they should
be kept scrupulously clean, and bathed in hot
solution of carbolic acid (1 in 60). They may then
be thickly dusted over with powdered boracic acid
and bandaged.</p></div>


<h3>STUDY AND STUDIO.</h3>

<p>N. M.—Cardiff Castle was the scene of the tedious
captivity of Robert, Duke of Normandy. In 1106
he fell into the hands of his brother Henry I., with
whom he had long been at strife, and he was
confined in this fortress, which had recently been
conquered from the Welsh. At first Robert was
allowed to take exercise among the fields and
woods of the neighbourhood. He attempted to
make his escape on horseback, and, having been
pursued and taken back, was condemned to closer
durance. Some historians say that his eyes were
put out by his brother’s orders; certain it is that he
lingered a prisoner for twenty-eight years, and
died at Cardiff Castle in 1135.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Pilgrim in a Sunny Land</span> (Beyrout, Syria).—The

have done work for the sake of mankind: their
“music” is the added happiness of humanity
which their efforts have secured. We think, as
you suggest, that your explanations mean much
the same thing. This fine poem will repay close
study.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Queensland Girl.</span>—What prettily painted note
paper you send us from your distant home!—1.
The competition you speak of is over.—2. Your
writing is admirable, distinct, well formed, and
most pleasant to look at and to read.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Olive Cambus.</span>—It is not necessary in writing for
the press to leave any extra space at the top of
foolscap paper. It is better to leave a margin on
your left hand as you write. The sheets should be
fastened together in the top left-hand corner, not
by a “clip,” but by a paper-fastener that goes
through a hole pierced in the sheets; any stationer
will sell you a box. Foolscap is, we think, preferable
to sermon paper. The great matter is to
have your MS. perfectly distinct and clear to read,
and only to write on one side of the page.</p></div>


<h3>MISCELLANEOUS.</h3>

<div class="blockquot_ans">

<p><span class="smcap">Yum-Yum.</span>—It is quite possible that the pain over
your eye may proceed from a little congestion, if in
the hollow over the ball of the eye. Perhaps your
spectacles are unsuitable, and there should be a
difference between the two glasses. There is often
a different focus in one eye from that of the other,
and the left one may be overstrained. We advise
you to consult an oculist or a good optician, to
test the sight of each. We are glad to give our
correspondent “<span class="smcap">Seaton Devon</span>” the benefit of
your information respecting the song, “Please
have You seen my Dolly?” It is (you say) composed
by F. W. Lancelott, and the words are by
E. Cympson. The publisher is F. Pitman, 20, Paternoster
Row, E.C.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miserable.</span>—We are never told in the Bible that “to
those who do not marry He will give a rich reward.”
No such thing. But during those terrible persecutions,
already begun, and to continue subsequently
to St. Paul’s time, women unmarried and without
children were in a preferable condition to those who
had them. Of course, to marry without a very
special bond of affection between you and your
husband, would be not only a bar to any happiness,
but also very wrong; and to marry without suitable
means to support and educate a family must entail
much suffering, mental and physical. From what
you say of your feelings, and that you only “care
for him in a way,” you would act wisely in declining
his offer. You say “the thought of living unloved
<i>unmans</i> me!” We hope you have no pretensions
to manliness!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">March Girl.</span>—Hares are said to be specially wild in
the month of March, and thence has arisen the term,
“Mad as a March hare.” According to Dr.
Brewer, the name “Neddy” was transferred from
the little low cart for which donkeys are employed
in Dublin, to the animals themselves. And the
meaning of the term as used for the cart refers to
the jolting which results from the lack of springs, and
makes those who drive in them to nod perpetually.
These, or a much similar description of cart was
also termed a “Noddy.”</p></div>
